	abstract = {The differential energy spectrum of galactic cosmic rays near Earth is often parameterized by the force field model with the only time?dependent parameter, the modulation potential ?. Here we present a series of reconstructed monthly values of the modulation potential for the period from July 1936 through December 2009. This works extends our earlier study by employing new data and improving the reconstruction method. The presented series is a composite of three parts. The most reliable part is based on data from the world network of sea level neutron monitors and covers the period since April 1964. The part between February 1951 and March 1964 is based on data from one to two mountain neutron monitors of IGY type and is characterized by larger uncertainties and possible systematic error. The part related to the period before 1951 is based on data from Forbush ground?based ionization chambers and is characterized by large uncertainties and should be taken with caveats. The reconstructed series has been tested against long?term data of balloon?borne measurements of flux of cosmic ray ionizing radiation in the stratosphere performed by the Lebedev Institute since 1957. The comparison shows good agreement since 1964 but suggests that the result before 1964 may contain larger errors in that the NM?based reconstruction method may underestimate the low energy part of GCR spectrum.},

	abstract = {To determine the characteristics of galactic and solar cosmic ray flux near Earth by using neutron monitor measurements, the observation data are usually submitted to analysis procedures involving extensive calculations and expert knowledge. For space weather applications an equally valid method is desirable that is straightforward, fast, and simple, to allow quasi-automatic data analysis in near real-time. For this procedure, a parameterized neutron monitor yield function is needed. The Geant4 software package allows to simulate the interactions of cosmic ray particles with the atmosphere and the matter of the neutron monitor by the Monte Carlo method and therefore offers the possibility to determine the specific neutron monitor yield in function of rigidity, altitude, and type of neutron monitor. The paper presents the results of such simulations and a comparison with previously determined yield functions. The new yield function is parameterized and can therefore easily be adapted for any neutron monitor at any
geographic location and altitude. The application of the newly generated yield function is demonstrated with the analysis of the neutron monitor data of the worldwide network during the maximum phase of the ground level enhancement during the solar flare on 13 December 2006.},

	abstract = {A ground?based neutron monitor (NM) is a standard tool to measure cosmic ray (CR) variability near Earth, and it is crucially important to know its yield function for primary CRs. Although there are several earlier theoretically calculated yield functions, none of them agrees with experimental data of latitude surveys of sea?level NMs, thus suggesting for an inconsistency. A newly computed yield function of the standard sea?level 6NM64 NM is presented here separately for primary CR protons and α?particles, the latter representing also heavier species of CRs. The computations have been done using the GEANT?4 PLANETOCOSMICS Monte?Carlo tool and a realistic curved atmospheric model. For the first time, an effect of the geometrical correction of the NM effective area, related to the finite lateral expansion of the CR induced atmospheric cascade, is considered, which was neglected in the previous studies. This correction slightly enhances the relative impact of higher?energy CRs (energy above 5?10 GeV/nucleon) in NM count rate. The new computation finally resolves the long?standing problem of disagreement between the theoretically calculated spatial variability of CRs over the globe and experimental latitude surveys. The newly calculated yield function, corrected for this geometrical factor, appears fully consistent with the experimental latitude surveys of NMs performed during three consecutive solar minima in 1976?1977, 1986?1987, and 1996?1997. Thus, we provide a new yield function of the standard sea?level NM 6NM64 that is validated against experimental data.},

In addition, particle and magnetic field measurements from Wind , the Advanced Composition Explorer , and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) are used in the analysis. The observations are fitted with good agreement between two independent numerical models of interplanetary transport. The rapid decrease of anisotropy from a high initial value cannot be explained by a simple model of interplanetary transport. Hence, we invoke a barrier or magnetic bottleneck consistent with an observed magnetic disturbance from an earlier coronal mass ejection that was located 0.3 AU beyond Earth's orbit at the time of the Bastille Day event. This work includes the first treatment of focused transport through a magnetic bottleneck. We conclude that the bottleneck reflected a major fraction (≈85\%) of the relativistic solar protons back toward Earth.},

This was the first such event to be observed by Spaceship Earth, an 11-station network of neutron monitors optimized for measuring the angular distribution of solar cosmic rays. We derive the particle density and anisotropy as functions of time and model these with numerical solutions of the Boltzmann equation. We conclude that transport in the interplanetary medium was diffusive in this event, with a radial mean free path of 0.17 AU. The high time resolution of the Spaceship Earth network and the fast particle speed permit accurate determination of particle injection timing at the solar source. We find that particle injection at the Sun began at 13:42 UT ±1 minute, about 14 minutes before the first arrival of particles at Earth, in close association with the onset of shock-related radio emissions and 15 minutes after liftoff of a coronal mass ejection (CME). Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that solar particles were accelerated to GeV energies on Easter 2001 by a CME-driven shock wave.},

Active geomagnetic conditions were associated with unusual variations in the flux of electrons on that date, which we interpret as a manifestation of an anomalously low and highly variable geomagnetic cutoff. Increasing the ring current intensity in the Tsyganenko model reduces the calculated effective cutoff rigidity somewhat, but to explain all of our observations, we must postulate that trajectories traditionally assumed to be forbidden are sometimes systematically converted into allowed trajectories. Within this model we can also identify field lines on which bursts of auroral X rays were generated.},

	abstract = {Extreme solar processes at the Sun on 2001 April 15 accelerated protons to relativistic energies, resulting in a ground-level enhancement in cosmic rays observed at Earth. The GOES 10 spacecraft measured the proton flux directly, and ground-based observatories measured the secondary responses to higher energy protons. We have modeled the ground-level response to this event using a technique that deduces the spectrum, arrival direction, and anisotropy of the high-energy protons. To investigate the acceleration process(es), we have employed theoretical shock and stochastic acceleration spectral forms in our fits to spacecraft and neutron-monitor data. In the case of stochastic acceleration, we use two different spectral forms. The first (model A) incorporates an idealized preacceleration step through monoenergetic injection. The second (model B) incorporates a more realistic injection function using preacceleration by DC electric fields in a reconnecting neutral current sheet. We find that at the rise, peak, and decline phases of the event (14:20, 14:30, and 14:45 UT, respectively), the spectrum between 120 MeV and 10 GeV is best fitted by a shock acceleration spectral form. This implies that protons were accelerated to relativistic energies either by a coronal shock or at the bow shock of the 2001 April 15 coronal mass ejection. In addition, reinvestigation of the 2000 July 14 solar event using the more realistic injection function (model B) further supports our earlier findings that MHD turbulence arising from magnetic reconnection from a dissipating neutral current sheet was important in relativistic proton production for that event.},

	abstract = {Although listed as one of the most significant events of the last 80 years, the space weather storm of late May 1967 has been of mostly fading academic interest. The storm made its initial mark with a colossal solar radio burst causing radio interference at frequencies between 0.01 and 9.0 GHz and near-simultaneous disruptions of dayside radio communication by intense fluxes of ionizing solar X-rays. Aspects of military control and communication were immediately challenged. Within hours a solar energetic particle event disrupted high-frequency communication in the polar cap. Subsequently, record-setting geomagnetic and ionospheric storms compounded the disruptions. We explain how the May 1967 storm was nearly one with ultimate societal impact, were it not for the nascent efforts of the United States Air Force in expanding its terrestrial weather monitoring-analysis-warning-prediction efforts into the realm of space weather forecasting. An important and long-lasting outcome of this storm was more formal Department of Defense-support for current-day space weather forecasting. This story develops during the rapid rise of solar cycle 20 and the intense Cold War in the latter half of the twentieth century. We detail the events of late May 1967 in the intersecting categories of solar-terrestrial interactions and the political-military backdrop of the Cold War. This was one of the “Great Storms” of the twentieth century, despite the apparent lack of large geomagnetically induced currents. Radio disruptions like those discussed here warrant the attention of today's radio-reliant, cellular-phone and satellite-navigation enabled world.},

	abstract = {The 23 February 1956 ground level enhancement of the solar cosmic ray 
intensity (GLE05) is the most famous among the proton events observed
since 1942. But we do not have a great deal of information on this event
due to the absence of solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field
measurements at that time. Furthermore, there were no X-Ray or gamma
observations and the information on the associated flare is limited.
Cosmic ray data was obtained exclusively by ground level detectors of
small size and in some cases of a non-standard design. In the present
work all available data from neutron monitors operating in 1956 were
analyzed, in order to develop a model of the solar cosmic ray behavior
during the event. The time-dependent characteristics of the cosmic ray
energy spectrum, cosmic ray anisotropy, and differential and integral
fluxes have been evaluated utilizing different isotropic and anisotropic
models. It is shown that the most outstanding features of this proton
enhancement were a narrow and extremely intense beam of
ultra-relativistic particles arriving at Earth just after the onset and
the unusually high maximum solar particle energy. However, the
contribution of this beam to the overall solar particle density and
fluency was not significant because of its very short duration and small
width. Our estimate of the integral flux for particles with energies
over 100 MeV places this event above all subsequent. Perhaps the number
of accelerated low energy particles was closer to a record value, but
these particles passed mainly to the west of Earth. Many features of this GLE are apparently
explained by the peculiarity of the particle interplanetary propagation
from a remote (near the limb) source. The quality of the available
neutron monitor data does not allow us to be certain of some details;
these may be cleared up by the incorporation into the analysis of data
from muonic telescopes and ionization chambers operating at that
time. Keywords. Interplanatary physics (Cosmic rays;

Twenty-six of these positions are near the South African magnetic anomaly, and six other points are in a region of the North Atlantic where Pomerantz and Agarwal have reported anomalous results. The cutoff rigidities have been obtained by detailed computation of the trajectories of cosmic rays at 0.01-bv rigidity intervals to allow for the effects of the penumbra. Differences greater than 15\% from the Quenby and Wenk threshold values have been found in the vicinity of South Africa, the South Atlantic, and the Canary Islands. Various latitude surveys are shown to exhibit consistency when plotted against the cutoff rigidities determined by this computational method. It is concluded that, though there is essentially no difference between the cutoff rigidities obtained using two currently accepted field models, these simulations of the geomagnetic field are not completely adequate over some parts of the earth to describe the cosmic-ray effects in their entirety. Cutoff rigidities for a number of neutron monitors are listed.},

	abstract = {The calculation of particle trajectories in the Earth's magnetic field has been a subject of interest since the time of St\"ormer. The fundamental problem is that the trajectory-tracing process involves using mathematical equations that have `no solution in closed form'. This difficulty has forced researchers to use the `brute force' technique of numerical integration of many individual trajectories to ascertain the behavior of trajectory families or groups. As the power of computers has improved over the decades, the numerical integration procedure has grown more tractable and while the problem is still formidable, thousands of trajectories can be computed without the expenditure of excessive resources. As particle trajectories are computed and the characteristics analyzed we can determine the cutoff rigidity of a specific location and viewing direction and direction and deduce the direction in space of various cosmic ray anisotropies. Unfortunately, cutoff rigidities are not simple parameters due to the chaotic behavior of the cosmic-ray trajectories in the cosmic ray penumbral region. As the computational problem becomes more manageable, there is still the issue of the accuracy of the magnetic field models. Over the decades, magnetic field models of increasing complexity have been developed and utilized. The accuracy of trajectory calculations employing contemporary magnetic field models is sufficient that cosmic ray experiments can be designed on the basis of trajectory calculations. However, the Earth's magnetosphere is dynamic and the most widely used magnetospheric models currently available are static. This means that the greatest uncertainly in the application of charged particle trajectories occurs at low energies.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have stressed the importance of solar energetic particle (SEP) transport under disturbed interplanetary conditions, including the case of detection inside a closed interplanetary magnetic loop ejected by a preceding solar event. In this case, particles might be observed to arrive from the far leg of the loop, thus arriving at the detector while traveling sunward. We perform numerical simulations of the focused transport of SEPs along Archimedean spiral and magnetic loop configurations. For loop configurations, we consider injection along either the near leg or the far leg of the loop, either with or without compression at the leading edge. We show that there are specific anisotropy signatures of transport in a closed magnetic loop configuration. SEPs traveling sunward cannot have a high, sustained anisotropy due to the effect of inverse focusing. As an example, the relativistic SEP event of 2003 October 28 exhibited unusual directional distributions, with an early peak of particle flow \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] ≈ 120° and a main peak \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] ≈ 80° from the radial direction. However, quantitative fitting of data from the Spaceship Earth network of polar neutron monitors indicates that injection along the far leg of an interplanetary loop is not a good description; our analysis strongly favors transport from the Sun to the Earth over a short path length of 1 AU.},

It has been shown that in the extensive showers both neutrons of moderate energies and radiations capable of producing such neutrons are present. The number of neutrons and neutron-producers in showers of different sizes is roughly proportional to the number of the electrons. The neutron-producers cannot be, at least in a large fraction, either electrons, or photons, or μ-mesons. Nuclear interactions induced by fast neutrons and protons are consequently thought to give the main contribution to the neutron production observed. The total neutron-producing-radiation is of the order of 2-3 percent of the electronic component of the showers at 3260 m. Its altitude variation is consistent with the assumption that nucleons constitute its main component.},

	abstract = {We formulate the modulation of galactic anisotropy of cosmic rays caused by their orbital deflection in the heliomagnetosphere. According to the formulation, the average sidereal i-th harmonic daily variation (i = 1,2,…) produced from the anisotropy from an arbitrary direction can be expressed by a linear combination of three basic vectors for uni-directional anisotropy and five basic vectors for bi-directional anisotropy. These vectors are obtained by calculating trajectories of cosmic rays (20−104GV) in a model magnetosphere having Parker's Archimedian spiral structure with a flat or a wavy neutral sheet in either of two polarity states, one is called “Positive” state (away field in the northern space of the neutral sheet and toward field in the southern space) and the other is called “Negative” state (reversed state of the above). Among general characteristics of the sidereal daily variations, the most remarkable features are: (1) The observable variations in low rigidity (≲ 2000 GV) can be produced even from an uni-directional anisotropy in the direction of the Earth's rotation axis. These variations are strongly dependent on the polarity state, i.e., they are greater in the Positive state than in the Negative. (2) Those produced from the anisotropy in the Equatorial plane also show the polarity dependence but contrary to the previous case they are greater in the Negative state than in the Positive. Their magnitude in the former state is not so small even in the extremely low rigidity (∼ 100 GV) as compared with that in high rigidity region. (3) These general characteristics are not altered by the introduction of the wavy neutral sheet or the magnetic irregularities, but the variations are affected more or less, depending on the heliolatitudinal extent of the wavy sheet or the degree of cosmic ray scattering with the irregularities, (4) Sidereal daily variation for the wavy sheet shows a toward-away field dependence similar to that of Swinson-type of solar origin, but the dependence is predominant in intermediate rigidity region (∼ 500 GV), in marked contrast to that of solar origin. (5) Finally, whichever its direction may be, the uni-directional anisotropy produces the sidereal diurnal variation common to two conjugate stations in the Northern and Southern hemisphere. If there is any difference between the observed variations at the stations, it should be interpreted as being due to higher order anisotropy such as the bi-directional anisotropy.},

In this paper, correlation coefficients between the neutron intensities in Morioka and Tokyo-Itabashi during a solar rotation interval are calculated using the neutron data obtained during the period 1971-1974 in Morioka and Tokyo-Itabashi. Dependences of the coefficients on geomagnetic activity and solar activity are studied and discussed in comparison with results from the cosmic ray data observed at the other cosmic ray stations. It is concluded that such correlations are closely related to the associated geomagnetic activity and solar activity. The time lag of cosmic ray modulation due to solar activity which amounts to approximately one year is suggested for the period 1972-1974. and it may be significantly changeable from year to year. 1.},

We present a methodology for extracting common temporal features across a set of individual time series observations. In particular, the methodology explores extreme observations within the time series, such as spikes, as a possible common temporal phenomenon. Wavelet basis functions are attractive in this sense, as they are localized in both time and frequency domains simultaneously, allowing for localized feature extraction from a time-varying signal. We apply wavelet basis function decomposition of individual time series, with corresponding wavelet shrinkage to remove noise. We then extract common temporal features using linear principal component analysis on the wavelet coefficients, before inverse transformation back to the time domain for clinical interpretation. We demonstrate the methodology on a subset of a large fetal activity study aiming to identify temporal patterns in fetal movement (FM) count data in order to explore formal FM counting as a screening tool for identifying fetal compromise and thus preventing adverse birth outcomes.

A further study of the events that happened on the Sun and affected the interplanetary space, and finally provoked the decreases of the galactic cosmic rays near Earth is performed. A statistical analysis of the amplitude of the cosmic ray decreases with solar and geomagnetic parameters is carried out.

The showers are co-spatial and in phase with periodic (6.6{\textasciitilde}hr) intensity pulsations of coronal loops of the sort described by Auchere et al. (2014) and Froment et al. (2015, 2017). These new observations make possible a unified description of both phenomena. Coronal rain and periodic intensity pulsations of loops are two manifestations of the same physical process: evaporation / condensation cycles resulting from a state of thermal nonequilibrium (TNE). The fluctuations around coronal temperatures produce the intensity pulsations of loops, and rain falls along their legs if thermal runaway cools the periodic condensations down and below transition-region (TR) temperatures. This scenario is in line with the predictions of numerical models of quasi-steadily and footpoint heated loops. The presence of coronal rain -- albeit non-periodic -- in several other structures within the studied field of view implies that this type of heating is at play on a large scale.},

Since beginning normal science operations on 1 May 2010, HMI has operated with remarkable continuity, e.g. during the more than five years of the SDO prime mission that ended 30 September 2015, HMI collected 98.4\% of all possible 45-second velocity maps; minimizing gaps in these full-disk Dopplergrams is crucial for helioseismology. HMI velocity, intensity, and magnetic-field measurements are used in numerous investigations, so understanding the quality of the data is important. We describe the calibration measurements used to track HMI performance and detail trends in important instrument parameters during the mission. Regular calibration sequences provide information used to improve and update the HMI data calibration. The set-point temperature of the instrument front window and optical bench is adjusted regularly to maintain instrument focus, and changes in the temperature-control scheme have been made to improve stability in the observable quantities. The exposure time has been changed to compensate for a 15\% decrease in instrument throughput. Measurements of the performance of the shutter and tuning mechanisms show that they are aging as expected and continue to perform according to specification. Parameters of the tunable-optical-filter elements are regularly adjusted to account for drifts in the central wavelength. Frequent measurements of changing CCD-camera characteristics, such as gain and flat field, are used to calibrate the observations. Infrequent expected events, such as eclipses, transits, and spacecraft off-points, interrupt regular instrument operations and provide the opportunity to perform additional calibration. Onboard instrument anomalies are rare and seem to occur quite uniformly in time. The instrument continues to perform very well.},

Data on intensity have been obtained from observations at the global ground network of neutron monitors and stratospheric sounding. The characteristics of the regions with an open magnetic field (coronal holes) have been introduced into the model in order to improve the description of long-term variations. The location (latitude), area, and magnetic flux of coronal holes have been used as parameters of this solar activity type manifestation. The modulation has been modeled for the entire studied period (1976–2012) and independently for periods with identical global solar magnetic field directions with regard to the cosmic ray variation delay relative to variations in the solar activity characteristics.

Up to December 2003 during solar activity cycle 23, 13 GLEs (Number from 55 to 67) have been recorded by the worldwide network of neutron monitors. Nine of the 13 GLEs (69\%) originated from the southern hemisphere and 11 of the 13 GLEs (85\%) originated from the western hemisphere. All GLEs originated from the solar activity region within a latitude strip between S20° and N40° and a longitude west of E10°. Each GLE corresponds to a solar fast coronal mass ejection (CME) which had the potential of producing disturbances to the geospace. The average speed of CMEs is high up to 1762kms−1. Among the 13 relevant CMEs 9 are responsible for nine major geomagnetic storms (defined by disturbance storm time index ⩽−100nT). The largest four geomagnetic storms (Dst⩽−277nT) correspond to the four GLEs (Nos. 59,62,65 and 66) which have the highest proton flux with energy {\textgreater}10MeV. It seems to imply that the solar proton events (SPEs) having great proton flux are more likely to be associated with major geomagnetic storms. Simultaneous existence of high flux SPEs, high optical flare classification, and fast halo CMEs near the central meridian of the Sun, as well as GLEs may be an effective indicator for predicting the occurrence of a strong geomagnetic storm.},

	abstract = {During extreme solar events such as big flares or/and energetic coronal mass ejections (CMEs) high energy particles are accelerated by the shocks formed in front of fast interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). The ICMEs (and their sheaths) also give rise to large geomagnetic storms which have significant effects on the Earth’s environment and human life. Around 14 solar cosmic ray ground level enhancement (GLE) events in solar cycle 23 we examined the cosmic ray variation, solar wind speed, ions density, interplanetary magnetic field, and geomagnetic disturbance storm time index (Dst). We found that all but one of GLEs are always followed by a geomagnetic storm with Dst⩽−50nT within 1–5 days later. Most(10/14) geomagnetic storms have Dst index⩽−100 nT therefore generally belong to strong geomagnetic storms. This suggests that GLE event prediction of geomagnetic storms is 93\% for moderate storms and 71\% for large storms when geomagnetic storms preceded by GLEs. All Dst depressions are associated with cosmic ray decreases which occur nearly simultaneously with geomagnetic storms. We also investigated the interplanetary plasma features. Most geomagnetic storm correspond significant periods of southward Bz and in close to 80\% of the cases that the Bz was first northward then turning southward after storm sudden commencement (SSC). Plasma flow speed, ion number density and interplanetary plasma temperature near 1AU also have a peak at interplanetary shock arrival. Solar cause and energetic particle signatures of large geomagnetic storms and a possible prediction scheme are discussed.},

	abstract = {Under an agreement on scientific cooperation between Brazil and Japan, a prototype detector of cosmic ray muons has been operating since March 2001 at Southern Space Observatory (SSO) located at São Martinho da Serra (29°S, 53°W), Brazil, in order to observe cosmic ray precursors of geomagnetic storms. This detector plays a key roll in the prototype network of muon observations together with two larger detectors operating in Japan and Australia. The planned extension of the detector in its size will complete the global coverage of our muon detector network. The prototype network has already discovered cosmic ray precursors of several magnetic storms, as reported by Munakata et al. (Munakata, K. et al.: 2000, J Geophys Res. 105, A12, pp. 27, 457–27, 468; Munakata K. et al.: 2001, Proceedings of ICRC.) We have also observed the Forbush Decreases (FDs), as well as the precursory enhancements of cosmic ray anisotropy preceding the onsets of geomagnetic storms. This report presents the description of the network and some results obtained since the prototype detector implementation.},

One of the main corrections of the primary data is the pressure correction due to the barometric effect. The barometric effect induces variations to the measured data of the neutron monitors which are related to the variations of the local atmospheric pressure of the stations. This correction requires the definition of the barometric coefficient which is calculated experimentally. The accurate calculation of the coefficient is a prerequisite for the quality of the data. This paper presents the implementation of an online tool which calculates the barometric coefficient of a cosmic ray station, by taking advantage of the fact that most stations publish their data on the Neutron Monitor Data Base.},

This approach gives the possibility to investigate both the dynamic behavior of neutron monitors (NM) (using response function) and the flight dose. The ambient dose equivalent during quiet solar activity and solar events (i.e., FDs and GLEs) were investigated for realistic flight plans issued from the Eurocontrol Demand Data Repository. The calculated ambient dose equivalents were compared with flight measurements in quiet solar conditions; comparisons are relevant and demonstrate the ability to estimate the dose level. The GLE model was validated for the GLEs 5 and 69 using the cosmic-ray variation recorded by NMs. The GLE model was applied to flight dose calculations. All of these results show that dose values vary drastically with the route path (latitude, longitude and altitude) and with the delay between the flight departure and the solar event occurrence. Doses induced by extreme GLE events were investigated specifically for London to New York flights, and resulting additional doses are a few hundred or 1,000 μSv, impacting significantly the annual effective dose. This highlights the importance of monitoring extreme solar events and using realistic semi-empirical and particle transport methods for reliable calculation of dose levels.},

From the correlation between atmospheric pressure deviations and relative cosmic ray variations, we obtain a barometric coefficient of –0.44 ± 0.01 \%/hPa. Once the data are corrected for atmospheric pressure, they are used to analyze temperature effects using four methods. Three methods are based on the surface temperature and the temperature at the altitude of maximum production of secondary cosmic rays. The fourth method, the integral method, takes into account the temperature height profile between 14 and 111 km above Complejo Astronómico El Leoncito. The results obtained from these four methods are compared on different time scales from seasonal time variations to scales related to the solar activity cycle. Our conclusion is that the integral method leads to better results to remove the temperature effect of the cosmic ray intensity observed at ground level.},

	abstract = {The cosmic-ray storm known as “Forbush decrease” is produced generally as a result of the transient diffusion-convection of cosmic rays caused by the passage of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) shock wave. It is emphasized, however, that the storm is frequently accompanied by non-diffusion-convection-type phenomena. In the present paper, the authors show the existence of such phenomena, which are dependent on local time. These are: (1) the precursory decrease of cosmic-ray intensity in front of the shock, which occurs in the morning (6–12 h), having nearly the same rigidity spectrum as that of the Forbush decrease; and (2) the post-shock increase, which belongs to the daily variation in general, but bears the following anomalous characters; a steep peak as high as the pre-storm intensity level, an extremely soft rigidity spectrum and a phase of 18–24 h in space considerably later than the usual. It is concluded that the precursory decrease is produced by the IMF-collimated outward flow of the low-density cosmic rays from the inside of the shock, and that the collimation is determined by the ratio between the ordered magnetic fields at the shock front and at the observation point. Inversely, the post-shock increase is produced by the IMF-collimated inward flow of the high-density cosmic rays from the outside. As an extreme case of the above phenomena, they also point out the existence of the IMF-guided square wave of cosmic-ray intensity with 24 h periodicity, which is produced as a result of the Earth's rotation in the unbalanced two-way flows along the magnetic lines of force connecting two separated regions occupied, respectively, by the high- and low-density cosmic rays. Finally, a serious influence of the precursory decrease on the determination of the commencement of Forbush decrease and also on the study of the precursory increase expected to appear in front of the shock wave, is discussed on the basis of definite examples.},

	abstract = {We study 50 cosmic-ray Forbush decreases (FDs) from the Oulu neutron monitor data during 1997–2005 that were associated with Earth-directed interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). Such events are generally thought to arise due to the shielding of cosmic rays by a propagating diffusive barrier. The main processes at work are the diffusion of cosmic rays across the large-scale magnetic fields carried by the ICME and their advection by the solar wind. In an attempt to better understand the relative importance of these effects, we analyze the relationship between the FD profiles and those of the interplanetary magnetic field ( B ) and the solar wind speed ( V sw ). Over the entire duration of a given FD, we find that the FD profile is generally (anti)correlated with the B and V sw profiles. This trend holds separately for the FD main and recovery phases too. For the recovery phases, however, the FD profile is highly anti-correlated with the V sw profile, but not with the B profile. While the total duration of the FD profile is similar to that of the V sw profile, it is significantly longer than that of the B profile. Using the convection–diffusion model, a significant contribution of advection by solar wind is found during the recovery phases of the FD.},

Using energetic proton flux data from the High Energy Telescope and Low Energy Telescope instruments aboard STEREO A together with the Earth-Moon-Mars Radiation Environment Module, we compute dose rates and accumulated doses during the event for both skin/eye and blood forming organs using four physically relevant levels of shielding. For spacesuit equivalent shielding, we compute a peak skin/eye dose rate of 1970 cGy-Eq/d, a value far greater than those of the 2003 Halloween storms or the January and March solar energetic particle events of 2012. However, due to the relative brevity of the event, the resulting accumulated dose was just 383 cGy-Eq, which is more aligned with the total doses of the 2003 Halloween and 2012 January/March events. Additionally, we use dose rates at STEREO B and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter/Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (LRO/CRaTER) during the event to show how the radiation impact is affected by the position of the ICME relative to the observer. Specifically, we find that the energetic particle event associated with the local shock and ICME passage at STEREO A caused greatly enhanced dose rates when compared to STEREO B and LRO/CRaTER, which were longitudinally distant from the ICME. The STEREO A/B dose rates used here will soon be made available to the community as a tool for studying the energetic particle radiation of solar events from different longitudes as a part of NASA's Heliophysics Virtual Observatories and on the Predictions of radiation from REleASE, EMMREM, and Data Incorporating CRaTER, COSTEP, and other SEP measurements (PREDICCS) and CRaTER websites.},

We study past events to optimize appropriate intensity threshold values and a baseline to determine the intensity increase. The highest-level alarm, which we term an “alert,” is generated when a 4\% increase is recorded at three stations in 3 min averaged data. At this level, the false alarm rate obtained by backtesting over the past 4.4 years is zero. Ten GLEs occurred in this period, and our system produced GLE alarms for nine events. Alarm times for these nine events are compared with satellite proton data. The GLE alert precedes the earliest alert from GOES (100 MeV or 10 MeV protons) by ∼10–30 min. Real-time GLE data may be viewed at http://neutronm.bartol.udel.edu/spaceweather. An automated e-mail alert system is under development.},

	abstract = {NASA’s Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission has coincided with a pronounced solar minimum. This allowed for easier detection of corotating interaction regions (CIRs). CIRs are formed by the interaction between fast and slow solar-wind streams ejected from source regions on the solar surface that rotate with the Sun. High-density plasma blobs that have become entrained at the stream interface can be tracked out to large elongations in data from the Heliospheric Imager (HI) instruments onboard STEREO. These blobs act as tracers of the CIR itself such that their HI signatures can be used to estimate CIR source location and radial speed. We estimate the kinematic properties of solar-wind transients associated with 40 CIRs detected by the HI instrument onboard the STEREO-A spacecraft between 2007 and 2010. We identify in-situ signatures of these transients at L1 using the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and compare the in-situ parameters with the HI results. We note that solar-wind transients associated with CIRs appear to travel at or close to the slow solar-wind speed preceding the event as measured in situ. We also highlight limitations in the commonly used analysis techniques of solar-wind transients by considering variability in the solar wind.},

We use observations of the two STEREO spacecraft (S/C) for the first 2.7 years of the mission, along with ground-based measurements of the solar magnetic field during the unusually long minimum of Solar Cycle 23. Owing to the unique configuration of the STEREO S/C orbits, we are able to investigate spatial variations in the intensity of the corotating ions on time scales of less than one solar rotation. The observations reveal that the occurrence of the strong CIR events was the most frequent at the beginning of the period. The inclination of the heliospheric current sheet relative to the heliographic equator (the tilt angle) was quite high in the first stage of the mission and gradually flattened with the time, followed by a decrease in the CIR activity. By examining the differences between measurements on the two STEREO S/C, we discuss how the changes in the position of the S/C relative to the CIRs affect the energetic particle observations. We combine STEREO observations with observations from the Ultra Low Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) instrument on the ACE S/C and argue that the main factor that controls the differences in the ion intensities is the latitudinal separation between the two STEREO S/C relative to the tilted CIRs. The position of the S/C is less important when the tilt angle is high. In this case we found that the CIR ion intensity positively correlates with the tilt angle.},

Special emphasis is given to the study of high-multiplicity events, i.e. those containing more than 100 reconstructed muons. Such high-multiplicity events demand primary cosmic rays with energy above \$10{\textasciicircum}\{16\}\$ eV.

	abstract = {A time-dependent model based on a numerical solution of Parker's transport equation is used to model the modulation of cosmic-ray protons, electrons, and helium for full 11 year and 22 year modulation cycles using a compound approach. This approach incorporates the concept of propagating diffusion barriers, increases in the heliospheric magnetic field as they propagate from the Sun throughout the heliosphere, time-dependent gradient, curvature, and current-sheet drifts, and other basic modulation mechanisms. The model results are compared with those of the observed 11 year and 22 year cycles for 1.2 GV electrons and 1.2 GV helium at Earth for the period of 1975-1998. The model solutions are also compared with the observed charge-sign-dependent modulation along the Ulysses trajectory for the period of 1990-1998. This compound approach to long-term modulation, especially charge-sign-dependent modulation, is found to be remarkably successful. It is shown that the model can account for the latitude dependence of cosmic-ray protons and electrons by assuming a large perpendicular diffusion in the polar direction. This approach contributes to an improved understanding of how diffusion and drifts vary from solar minimum to maximum modulation and what the time dependence of the heliospheric diffusion coefficients may be. It is found that less than 10\% of the available drifts are needed at solar maximum, when the solar magnetic field reverses, to explain, e.g., the observed electron-to-proton ratio along the Ulysses trajectory.},

	abstract = {A time-dependent model based on a numerical solution of Parker's transport equation is used to model the modulation of cosmic-ray protons, electrons, and helium for full 11 year and 22 year modulation cycles using a compound approach. This approach incorporates the concept of propagating diffusion barriers, increases in the heliospheric magnetic field as they propagate from the Sun throughout the heliosphere, time-dependent gradient, curvature, and current-sheet drifts, and other basic modulation mechanisms. The model results are compared with those of the observed 11 year and 22 year cycles for 1.2 GV electrons and 1.2 GV helium at Earth for the period of 1975-1998. The model solutions are also compared with the observed charge-sign-dependent modulation along the Ulysses trajectory for the period of 1990-1998. This compound approach to long-term modulation, especially charge-sign-dependent modulation, is found to be remarkably successful. It is shown that the model can account for the latitude dependence of cosmic-ray protons and electrons by assuming a large perpendicular diffusion in the polar direction. This approach contributes to an improved understanding of how diffusion and drifts vary from solar minimum to maximum modulation and what the time dependence of the heliospheric diffusion coefficients may be. It is found that less than 10\% of the available drifts are needed at solar maximum, when the solar magnetic field reverses, to explain, e.g., the observed electron-to-proton ratio along the Ulysses trajectory.},

	abstract = {By means of an analysis of data from eight neutron monitor (NM) stations with different geomagnetic cutoff rigidities, we found an unusual latitudinal effect observed in the cosmic-ray (CR) modulation during the last solar cycles. Since the beginning of the ground-based cosmic-ray monitoring, it is known that the solar-cycle modulation is more evident in data from high latitude than from the medium and low latitudes, showing an expected geomagnetic cutoff rigidity effect. However, a more detailed look shows a new latitudinal effect in cycle 24: while the magnitude of the solar modulation in the low-latitude data remains the same for the last three solar minima, the last solar minimum caused a more intense peak in the polar NM data than in the previous cycles. After correcting the data for the geomagnetic changes of the period, we found an anomalous solar modulation in the last cycle. This suggests a weaker heliospheric modulation at low-energy particles (responsible for the NM counting in polar sites) now than in the previous cycles, while there is no significant difference of the modulation for the more energetic part of the CR spectrum. Our result can be associated with changes of the solar wind turbulence, which would corroborate some recent studies about the last solar minimum phase, and indicates that this new solar modulation feature is still present in the current solar maximum stage.},

A new perspective of this contribution is that cosmic ray data with a rigidity of 10 GV at the top of the atmosphere obtained from many ground-based neutron monitors were used. The proposed empirical relation gave much better results than those in previous works concerning the hysteresis effect. The proposed models obtained from a combination of solar activity indices and heliospheric parameters give a standard deviation {\textless} 10 \% for all the cases. The correlation coefficient between the cosmic ray variations of 10 GV and the sunspot number reached a value of r=−0.89 with a time lag of 13.6±0.4 months. The best reproduction of the cosmic ray intensity is obtained by taking into account solar and interplanetary indices such as sunspot number, interplanetary magnetic field, CME index, and heliospheric current sheet tilt. The standard deviation between the observed and calculated values is about 7.15 \% for all of solar cycle 23; it also works very well during the different phases of the cycle. Moreover, the use of the cosmic ray intensity of 10 GV during the long minimum period between cycles 23 and 24 is of special interest and is discussed in terms of cosmic ray intensity modulation.},

The new approach is an extension of this study to the influence of the solar magnetic field parameters, such as the mean magnetic field and the polar magnetic field, on the cosmic ray (CR) modulations. Using the wavelet analysis method a major periodicity of about 20-21 years was confirmed in the solar magnetic field data, indicating the existence of the solar magnetic cycle in CR variations. The best empirical relation of the cosmic ray modulation taking into account the sunspot number, the CME-index, the mean solar magnetic field and the solar polar field was improved significantly: a relative root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the observed and the calculated cosmic ray intensity values is found to be 8.7\% instead to the previous one of about 10\%.},

	abstract = {NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) was launched 11 February 2010 with 3 instruments on board, including the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). Since beginning normal operations on 1 May 2010, HMI has observed the Sun's entire visible disk almost continuously. HMI collects sequences of polarized filtergrams taken at a fixed cadence with two 4096 x 4096 cameras from which are computed arcsecond-resolution maps of photospheric observables: the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity and magnetic field, continuum intensity, line width, line depth, and the Stokes polarization parameters, I Q U V, at 6 wavelengths. Two processing pipelines implemented at the SDO Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC) at Stanford University compute observables from calibrated Level-1 filtergrams. One generates LoS quantities every 45s, and the other, primarily for the vector magnetic field, computes averages on a 720s cadence. Corrections are made for static and temporally changing CCD characteristics, bad pixels, image alignment and distortion, polarization irregularities, filter-element uncertainty and non-uniformity, as well as Sun-spacecraft velocity. This report explains issues affecting the resulting physical quantities, describes the impact of regular updates to the instrument calibration, and shows how the computations are optimized for actual HMI observations. During the 5 years of the SDO prime mission, regular calibration sequences have been used to regularly improve and update the instrument calibration and to monitor instrument changes. The instrument more than satisfies the original specifications for data quality and continuity. The procedures described here still have significant room for improvement. The most significant remaining systematic errors are associated with the spacecraft orbital velocity.},

The toroidal field revealed the first early signs of cycle 24 at high latitudes, especially in the northern hemisphere, appearing as far back as 2003 in the WSO data and 2004 in MDI. As in previous cycles, the feature moves gradually equatorward. Cycles overlap and the pattern associated with each cycle lasts about 17 years.

We give advice on method choice, tuning for performance, methods for initialization, tests of convergence, troubleshooting, and use of the chain output to produce or report parameter estimates with associated uncertainties. We argue that autocorrelation time is the most important test for convergence, as it directly connects to the uncertainty on the sampling estimate of any quantity of interest.

The aim of this study was to perform multiple dataset imputation in order to depict the observational dataset. The study has used the monthly time series of GCR Climax (CLMX) and Roma (ROME) from 1960 to 2004 to simulate scenarios of 10\%, 20\%, 30\%, 40\%, 50\%, 60\%, 70\%, 80\% and 90\% of missing data compared to observed ROME series, with 50 replicates. Then, the CLMX station as a proxy for allocation of these scenarios was used. Three different methods for monthly dataset imputation were selected: AMÉLIA II – runs the bootstrap Expectation Maximization algorithm, MICE – runs an algorithm via Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations and MTSDI – an Expectation Maximization algorithm-based method for imputation of missing values in multivariate normal time series. The synthetic time series compared with the observed ROME series has also been evaluated using several skill measures as such as RMSE, NRMSE, Agreement Index, R, R2, F-test and t-test. The results showed that for CLMX and ROME, the R2 and R statistics were equal to 0.98 and 0.96, respectively. It was observed that increases in the number of gaps generate loss of quality of the time series. Data imputation was more efficient with MTSDI method, with negligible errors and best skill coefficients. The results suggest a limit of about 60\% of missing data for imputation, for monthly averages, no more than this. It is noteworthy that CLMX, ROME and KIEL stations present no missing data in the target period. This methodology allowed reconstructing 43 time series.},

	abstract = {The Sun is an effective particle accelerator producing solar energetic particle (SEP) events during which particles up to several GeVs can be observed. Those events observed at Earth with the neutron monitor network are called ground level enhancements (GLEs). Although these events with a high energy component have been investigated for several decades, a clear relation between the spectral shape of the SEPs outside the Earth's magnetosphere and the increase in neutron monitor count rate has yet to be established. Hence, an analysis of these events is of interest for the space weather as well as the solar event community. In this work, SEP events with protons accelerated to above 500 MeV have been identified using data from the Electron Proton Helium Instrument (EPHIN) aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) between 1995 and 2015. For a statistical analysis, onset times have been determined for the events and the proton energy spectra were derived and fitted with a power law. As a result, a list of 42 SEP events with protons accelerated to above 500 MeV measured with the EPHIN instrument onboard SOHO is presented. The statistical analysis based on the fitted spectral slopes and absolute intensities is discussed with special emphasis on whether or not an event has been observed as GLE. Furthermore, a correlation between the derived intensity at 500 MeV and the observed increase in neutron monitor count rate has been found for a subset of events.},

The flare itself was long in duration, and a halo coronal mass ejection (CME) was emitted. In addition, a radiation storm, that is, solar energetic particles (SEP), began to reach the Earth at 13:30 UT in the aftermath of the solar blast, meeting the condition of an S1 (minor) radiation storm level. In temporal coincidence with the onset of the S1 radiation storm, the Tupi telescopes located within the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) detected a fast rise in the muon counting rate, caused by relativistic protons from this solar blast, with a confidence of up to 3.5\% at peak. At the time of the solar blast, of all ground-based detectors, the Tupi telescopes had the best geoeffective location. Indeed, in association with the radiation storm, a gradual increase in the particle intensity was found in some neutron monitors (NMs), all of them in the west region relative to the Sun–Earth line, yet within the geoeffective region. However, their confidence levels are smaller: up to 3\%. The fast rising observed at Tupi suggests possible detection of solar particles emitted during the impulsive phase, following by a gradual phase observed also at NMs. Details of these observations, including the expected energy spectrum, are reported.},

	abstract = {In order to reveal mechanisms of the generation of solar cosmic rays, the spectrum of an event of the groundlevel enhancement on October 28, 2003 (the GLE65 event) in a maximally wide energy range has been analyzed using direct measurements of solar particle fluxes on the АСЕ, GOES, and WIND spacecrafts, as well as measurements on the worldwide network of neutron monitors. The spectrum in the relativistic energy range has been estimated within the previously proposed “effective-energy method.” In this method, each ground-based instrument is assigned the corresponding effective momentum (or energy) of primary particles at which the flux of solar cosmic rays is determined. The effective momentum is chosen such that errors in the determination of the solar-particle spectrum are minimized. It has been shown that the error of the estimate of the effective momentum within the proposed method for the determination of solar-particle fluxes is no more than 20 MeV/c. It has been found that the spectrum of solar cosmic rays from the event under study measured in the orbit of the Earth extends from ≈40 keV to ≈5 GeV and is described by a power law with an exponential cutoff at relativistic energies. A quasilinear theory of the regular acceleration of charged particles by shock waves in the lower corona of the Sun, which was developed at the Shafer Institute of Cosmophysical Research and Aeronomy, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, has been used to reveal the nature of solar cosmic rays. It has been shown that the acceleration of solar cosmic rays on the front of a coronal shock wave in the event under study ended at a distance of no longer than four radii of the Sun.},

	abstract = {In 2001 the Ulysses spacecraft crossed the ecliptic plane near perihelion. The heliographic longitude with respect to the Earth was within ± 20° of the west solar limb while it was ± 15° of the ecliptic plane, which meant that coronal mass ejections seen off the solar west limb were likely to pass over Ulysses. On 10 May the largest {\textgreater} 38 keV electron intensity of the mission, since the Jovian encounter in 1992, was observed, which was accompanied by a fast perpendicular shock. This event was preceded by a fast coronal mass ejection some two and a half days earlier which is the probable source of the shock. However, both the ACE spacecraft and Ulysses observed, simultaneously, an intense, prompt electron event on 7 May from a solar flare associated with earlier coronal mass ejections also observed off the west limb; Ulysses was magnetically connected to a longitude well behind the west limb. ACE did not observe any (at the 0.1\% level) energetic electrons which were associated with the 10 May event seen at Ulysses. We discuss in detail the energetic particles seen at the two spacecraft during 7–11 May, with the objective of understanding the origin of the intense electron event seen on 10 May and the manner in which particles escaping from the shock populate the inner heliosphere. The energy spectrum of the ions at both ACE and Ulysses exhibits a maximum at around 400 keV; this form of the spectrum was seen at the shock itself. It appears that the strong shock driven by the fast coronal mass ejection is able to populate a large fraction of the inner heliosphere with accelerated ions. The shock-accelerated electrons do not pervade the inner heliosphere in the same manner as the ions. We suggest that the electron acceleration was enhanced by the presence of multiple coronal mass ejections.},

	abstract = {A systematic correlative study has been performed since long to establish a significant relationship between cosmic ray intensity and different solar/heliospheric activity parameters and study is extended to recent solar cycle 23. In the present work yearly average of sunspot number (Rz), interplanetary magnetic field (B) have been used to correlate with yearly average cosmic ray intensity derived from the data of Moscow neutron monitor. It is noticed that for four different solar cycles 20–23 the cosmic ray intensity is found to anti-correlated with sunspot numbers (Rz) and interplanetary magnetic field (B) with some discrepancy. However, the interplanetary magnetic field B shows a good positive correlation with Rz for four different solar cycles. The interplanetary magnetic field strength (B) shows a weak negative correlation (−0.35) with cosmic rays for the solar cycle 20, whereas it shows a high anti-correlation for the solar cycles 21–23 (−0.76,−0.69). Modulation of cosmic rays during solar cycle 20 (1964–1976) presents discrepancies regarding the importance of IMF B for long-term modulation at 1 AU for the cycle 20. A significant contribution to modulation from the termination shock during solar cycle 20 could dilute the correlation of cosmic rays with the interplanetary magnetic field B at 1 AU for that cycle. The perturbations of the heliosphere is weaker and less widely spread during solar cycle 20 than during other solar cycles. This might lead to a situation where the heliospheric perturbations are relatively small for cosmic ray particles allowing these particles to reach the Earth as if it was a minimum solar activity period. This implies that the heliospheric perturbations caused by solar activity in the descending phase of solar cycle 20 were quite local and could not result in global modulation of cosmic rays. These results demonstrate that the heliosphere evolved to the quite time structure very early in the declining phase of the solar cycle 20, implying an exceptionally fast recovery of the cosmic ray level and a long flat cosmic ray maximum during 1972–1977. This exceptional heliospheric evolution led to the negative lag between cosmic ray and solar activity cycle observed in the declining phase of the solar cycle 20.},

We compare the long-term GCR modulation with the CME occurrence rate at all, low, and high latitudes, as well as the observed CME parameters (width and speed). Twenty-seven day averages of CME occurrence rates and CME properties from 1996 January to 2003 December are presented in the Appendix. The general anticorrelation between GCR intensity and the CME rate is relatively high ( -0.88). However, when we divide the CME rate into low- and high-latitude rates and compare them with the GCR intensity during the ascending phase of solar cycle 23, we find a lower anticorrelation between the low-latitude the CME rate and GCR intensity ( -0.71) and a very high anticorrelation between the high-latitude CME rate and GCR intensity ( -0.94). This suggests that, in general, CMEs could cause the decrease in the GCR flux in the inner heliosphere, as stated by the global merged interaction region (GMIR) theory. In particular, during the ascending phase of cycle 23 ( qA {\textgreater} 0), this flux comes mainly from heliospheric polar regions. Thus, high-latitude CMEs may play a central role in the long-term cosmic-ray modulation during this phase of the cycle by blocking the polar entrance of GCRs to the inner heliosphere. This study supports the scenario in which CMEs, among other structures, are the building blocks of GMIRs, although we propose that the spherical shells (GMIRs) are closed separately at polar and equatorial regions by CMEs of different latitudes. Our results suggest that all CME properties show some correlation with the GCR intensity, although there is no specific property (width, speed, or a proxy of energy) that definitely has a higher correlation with GCR intensity.},

For example, the sector-structure-dependent sidereal diurnal variation produced from the cosmic-ray radial density gradient and the North-South asymmetric sidereal diurnal variation produced from the bidirectional anisotropy responsible for the solar semi-diurnal variation belong to this category. Owing to the obliquity, these diurnal variations show the characteristic eigenphase of 18 h or 6 h in sidereal time, depending on the kind of the sector structure (toward or away) for the former or on the observation site (northern or southern hemisphere) for the latter. It is noted, however, that the above eigenphase is only approximate and, if we consider the effect of the inclination of the solar equatorial plane against the ecliptic plane on these variations, the eigenphase lags by about 0.5 to 0.7 h, depending on the kind of the variation. The present paper provides the exact representation of these variations, for the use of eliminating them from the observed sidereal variation in order to obtain the galactic anisotropy of cosmic rays.},

In this connection the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field parameters and cosmic ray variations have been compared with geomagnetic activity represented by the equatorial Dst index from the beginning 1965 to the end of 2012. Dst index is commonly used as the solar wind–magnetosphere–ionosphere interaction characteristic. The important drivers in interplanetary medium which have effect on cosmic rays as CMEs (coronal mass ejections) and CIRs (corotating interaction regions) undergo very strong changes during their propagation to the Earth. Because of this CMEs, coronal holes and the solar spot numbers (SSN) do not adequately reflect peculiarities concerned with the solar wind arrival to 1AU. Therefore, the geomagnetic indices have some inestimable advantage as continuous series other the irregular solar wind measurements. We have compared the yearly average variations of Dst index and the solar wind parameters with cosmic ray data from Moscow, Climax, and Haleakala neutron monitors during the solar cycles 20–23. The descending phases of these solar cycles (CSs) had the long-lasting solar wind high speed streams occurred frequently and were the primary contributors to the recurrent Dst variations. They also had effects on cosmic rays variations. We show that long-term Dst variations in these solar cycles were correlated with the cosmic ray count rate and can be used for study of CR variations. Global temperature variations in connection with evolution of Dst index and CR variations is discussed.},

	abstract = {IceCube is a cubic-kilometer Cherenkov detector in the deep ice at the geographic South Pole. The dominant event yield is produced by penetrating atmospheric muons with energies above several 100 GeV. Due to its large detector volume, IceCube provides unique opportunities to study atmospheric muons with large statistics in detail. Measurements of the energy spectrum and the lateral separation distribution of muons oﬀer insights into hadronic interactions during the air shower development and can be used to test hadronic models. We will present an overview of various measurements of atmospheric muons in IceCube, including the energy spectrum of muons between 10 TeV and 1 PeV. This is used to derive an estimate of the prompt contribution of muons, originating from the decay of heavy (mainly charmed) hadrons and unﬂavored mesons. We will also present measurements of the lateral separation distributions of TeV muons between 150 m and 450 m for several initial cosmic ray energies between 1 PeV and 16 PeV. Finally, the angular distribution of atmospheric muons in IceCube will be discussed.},

	abstract = {Massive companions in close orbits around G dwarfs are thought to undergo rapid orbital decay due to runaway tidal dissipation. We report here the discovery of WASP-128b, a brown dwarf discovered by the WASP survey transiting a G0V host on a 2.2 d orbit, where the measured stellar rotation rate places the companion in a regime where tidal interaction is dominated by dynamical tides. Under the assumption of dynamical equilibrium, we derive a value of the stellar tidal quality factor log \{Q\_{\textbackslash}star {\textasciicircum}' \vphantom{\{}\}\} = 6.96 ± 0.19. A combined analysis of ground-based photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy reveals a mass and radius of the host, M\_{\textbackslash}star = 1.16± 0.04 M\_\{☉ \}, R\_{\textbackslash}star = 1.16± 0.02 R\_\{☉ \}, and for the companion, M\_b = 37.5± 0.8 M\_J, R\_b = 0.94± 0.02 R\_J, placing WASP-128b in the driest parts of the brown dwarf desert, and suggesting a mild inflation for its age. We estimate a remaining lifetime for WASP-128b similar to that of some ultra-short period massive hot Jupiters, and note it may be a propitious candidate for measuring orbital decay and testing tidal theories.},

	abstract = {Context. It is well known that the polarity of the Sun's magnetic field reverses or flips around the maximum of each 11 year solar cycle. This is commonly known as polar field reversal and plays a key role in deciding the polar field strength at the end of a cycle, which is crucial for the prediction of the upcoming cycle. Aims: We aim to investigate solar polar fields during cycle 24, using measurements of solar magnetic fields in the latitude range 55°-90° and
78°-90°, to report a prolonged and unusual hemispheric asymmetry in the polar field reversal pattern in solar cycle 24. Methods: This study was carried out using medium resolution line-of-sight synoptic magnetograms from the magnetic database of the National Solar Observatory at Kitt Peak (NSO/KP), USA for the period between February 1975 and October 2017, covering solar cycles 21-24 and high-resolution line-of-sight synoptic magnetograms from the Michaelson Doppler Imager instrument onboard the Solar Heliospheric Observatory. Synoptic
magnetograms using radial measurements from the Heliospheric Magnetic Imager instrument onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, covering solar cycle 23 and 24, were also used. Results: We show that the southern solar hemisphere unambiguously reversed polarity in mid-2013 while the reversal in the field in the northern solar hemisphere started as early as June 2012, was followed by a sustained period of near-zero field strength lasting until the end of 2014, after which the field began to show a clear rise from its near-zero value. While this study compliments a similar study carried out using microwave brightness measurements which claimed that the field reversal process in cycle 24 was completed by the end of 2015, our results show that the field reversal in cycle 24 was completed earlier that is, in late 2014. Signatures of this unusual field reversal pattern were also clearly identifiable in the solar wind, using our observations of interplanetary scintillation at 327 MHz which supported our magnetic field observations and confirmed that the field reversal process was completed at the end of 2014.},

	abstract = {Under current conditions, the cosmic ray spectrum incident on the Earth is dominated by particles with energies {\textless} 1 GeV. Astrophysical sources including high energy solar flares, supernovae and gamma ray bursts produce high energy cosmic rays (HECRs) with drastically higher energies. The Earth is likely episodically exposed to a greatly increased HECR flux from such events, some of which lasting thousands to millions of years. The air showers produced by HECRs ionize the atmosphere and produce harmful secondary particles such as muons and neutrons. Neutrons currently contribute a significant radiation dose at commercial passenger airplane altitude. With higher cosmic ray energies, these effects will be propagated to ground level. This work shows the results of Monte Carlo simulations quantifying the neutron flux due to high energy cosmic rays at various primary energies and altitudes. We provide here lookup tables that can be used to determine neutron fluxes from primaries with total energies 1 GeV - 1 PeV. By convolution, one can compute the neutron flux for any arbitrary CR spectrum. Our results demonstrate that deducing the nature of primaries from ground level neutron enhancements would be very difficult.},

From the anticorrelation between the number of solar flares, relative number of sunspots and that of events, we obtain the formula through an exponential fitting model. Furthermore, we quantitatively find the correlation between the daily average number of cosmic ray events and the characteristic solar activity parameters, including the number, the area and the latitude of sunspot groups within one month. Turning to the combined effects of solar activity and atmospheric pressure, we calculate the critical interval, beyond which the influence of solar activity on the number of events is weaker.},

	abstract = {Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are affected by solar modulation while they propagate through the heliosphere. The study of the time variation of GCR spectra observed at Earth can shed light on the underlying physical processes, specifically diffusion and particle drifts. Recently, the AMS-02 experiment measured with very high accuracy the time variation of the cosmic-ray proton and helium flux between 2011 May and 2017 May in the rigidity range from 1 to 60 GV. In this work, a comprehensive three-dimensional steady-state numerical model is used to solve Parker’s transport equation and reproduce the monthly proton fluxes observed by AMS-02. We find that the rigidity slope of the perpendicular mean free path above 4 GV remains constant, while below 4 GV, it increases during solar maximum. Assuming the same mean free paths for helium and protons, the models are able to reproduce the time behavior of the p/He ratio observed by AMS-02. The dependence of the diffusion tensor on the particle mass-to-charge ratio, A/Z, is found to be the main cause of the time dependence of p/He below 3 GV.},

	abstract = {By extending our previously established model, here we present a new model called “PHITS-based Analytical Radiation Model in the Atmosphere (PARMA) version 3.0,” which can instantaneously estimate terrestrial cosmic ray fluxes of neutrons, protons, ions with charge up to 28 (Ni), muons, electrons, positrons, and photons nearly anytime and anywhere in the Earth’s atmosphere. The model comprises numerous analytical functions with parameters whose numerical values were fitted to reproduce the results of the extensive air shower (EAS) simulation performed by Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System (PHITS). The accuracy of the EAS simulation was well verified using various experimental data, while that of PARMA3.0 was confirmed by the high R2 values of the fit. The models to be used for estimating radiation doses due to cosmic ray exposure, cosmic ray induced ionization rates, and count rates of neutron monitors were validated by investigating their capability to reproduce those quantities measured under various conditions. PARMA3.0 is available freely and is easy to use, as implemented in an open-access software program EXcel-based Program for Calculating Atmospheric Cosmic ray Spectrum (EXPACS). Because of these features, the new version of PARMA/EXPACS can be an important tool in various research fields such as geosciences, cosmic ray physics, and radiation research.},

	abstract = {A new model called “PHITS-based Analytical Radiation Model in the Atmosphere (PARMA) version 4.0” was developed to facilitate instantaneous estimation of not only omnidirectional but also angular differential energy spectra of cosmic ray fluxes anywhere in Earth’s atmosphere at nearly any given time. It consists of its previous version, PARMA3.0, for calculating the omnidirectional fluxes and several mathematical functions proposed in this study for expressing their zenith-angle dependences. The numerical values of the parameters used in these functions were fitted to reproduce the results of the extensive air shower simulation performed by Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System (PHITS). The angular distributions of ground-level muons at large zenith angles were specially determined by introducing an optional function developed on the basis of experimental data. The accuracy of PARMA4.0 was closely verified using multiple sets of experimental data obtained under various global conditions. This extension enlarges the model’s applicability to more areas of research, including design of cosmic-ray detectors, muon radiography, soil moisture monitoring, and cosmic-ray shielding calculation.

	abstract = {This paper analyses atmospheric ionizing radiations induced by Galactic and Solar Cosmic Rays (GCR and SCR, respectively) thanks to continuous measurements of neutron spectrum operated in high-altitude stations. Analyses are reinforced using GCR and SCR models, and extensive air shower descriptions based on nuclear transport simulations. First analyses were focused on neutron fluxes as function of altitude. Secondly, atmospheric ionizing radiation impacts on biological doses during quiet period and extreme solar events are presented. On the basis of the relevant comparisons conducted for ambient dose equivalent during quiet solar activity, but also for the comic ray variations calculated and recorded on neutron monitor (NM) during Ground Level Enhancement (GLE) event. GLE 5 model was applied to London ↔ New-york flight dose calculations. All of these results show that dose values vary drastically, on the one hand with the route path (latitude, longitude altitude), on the other hand with the phasing of the solar event. Specific case of Antarctica is discussed because it combines both the high altitude and the very low magnetic field. Analyses show that ionizing radiation in Antarctica environment can be a problematic from the point of view of the human dose, which exerts classical recommendations established for public. This highlights the importance of monitoring atmospheric ionizing radiation, more particularly extreme solar events, then to develop semi-empirical and particle transport method for reliable calculation of dose levels.},

	abstract = {AbstractNeutrons contribute a significant radiation dose at commercial passenger airplane altitudes. With cosmic ray energies {\textgreater} 1 GeV, these effects could, in principle, be propagated to ground level. Under current conditions, the cosmic ray spectrum incident on the Earth is dominated by particles with energies {\textless} 1 GeV. Astrophysical shocks from events such as supernovae accelerate high-energy cosmic rays (HECRs) well above this range. The Earth is likely episodically exposed to a greatly increased HECR flux from such events. Solar events of smaller energies are much more common and short lived but still remain a topic of interest due to the ground level enhancements they produce. The air showers produced by cosmic rays (CRs) ionize the atmosphere and produce harmful secondary particles such as muons and neutrons. Although the secondary spectra from current day terrestrial cosmic ray flux are well known, this is not true for spectra produced by many astrophysical events. This work shows the results of Monte Carlo simulations quantifying the neutron flux due to CRs at various primary energies and altitudes. We provide here look-up tables that can be used to determine neutron fluxes from proton primaries with kinetic energies of 1 MeV–1 PeV. By convolution, one can compute the neutron flux for any arbitrary CR spectrum. This contrasts with all other similar works, which are spectrum dependent. Our results demonstrate the difficulty in deducing the nature of primaries from the spectrum of ground level neutron enhancements.},

Hess's original observation was that gold-foil electrometers carried to an altitude of 5300 m indicated a rapid increase of ionization with elevation.

Throughout the 1930s, and until the 1950s, before man-made particle accelerators reached very high energies, cosmic rays served as a unique source of particles for studies in high-energy physics, and led to the discovery of various subatomic particles, including the positron and the muon (Powell {\textless}span class='italic'{\textgreater}et al.{\textless}/span{\textgreater}1959).

Employing Monte Carlo simulations with the PLANETOCOSMICS code we investigate the correlation between the geomagnetic ﬁeld structure and the cutoff rigidity. We show that the geometry of the magnetic ﬁeld has a considerable inﬂuence on the resulting cutoff rigidity distribution. Furthermore, we will present a simple geometry-based parameter, δB, which is able to reﬂect the location-dependent cutoff rigidity. We show that this correlation is also visible in the temporal evolution of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, at least over the last 100 yr. Using latitude scans with neutron monitors, changes of the relative counting rates at different positions are calculated, showing small variations for, e.g., Kiel and Moscow, while large ones occur at Mexico City as well as on the British Virgin Islands.},

	abstract = {We report the first systematic survey of cosmic ray precursors of geomagnetic storms. Our data set comprises the 14 “major” geomagnetic storms (peak Kp ≥ 8−) identified by Gosling et al. [1990] together with 25 large storms (peak Kp ≥ 7−) observed from 1992 through 1998. After eliminating events for which the muon detector network had poor coverage of the sunward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) direction, we determined that 15 of the remaining 22 events (68\%) had identifiable cosmic ray precursors with typical lead times ranging from 6 to 9 hours prior to the storm sudden commencement (SSC). Of the 15 precursors, 10 were of the “loss cone” (LC) type which is characterized by an intensity deficit confined to a narrow pitch angle region around the sunward IMF direction. Cosmic rays in the loss cone presumably originate in the cosmic-ray-depleted region downstream of the approaching shock. The remaining five precursors were of the “enhanced variance” (EV) type which is characterized by intensity increases or decreases that do not systematically align with the IMF direction. The incidence of precursors increases with storm size; for instance, 89\% of storms with peak Kp greater than or equal to 8.0 had precursors. Our results show that the muon detector network can be a useful tool in space weather forecasting. However, new detector(s) installed to fill major gaps in the present network are urgently required for better understanding the nature of precursors and for reliable space weather forecasting.},

However, a strong rigidity dependence as well as an unusual behavior of the cross correlation function is found for the descending phase of cycle 20. We study the evolution of cosmic ray and solar activity cycles in a three?dimensional phase space by means of the delayed component method. While all solar activity cycles and most cosmic ray cycles are planar, cosmic ray cycle 20 is significantly three?dimensional. A concept of the momentary phase of a cycle is introduced, and the phase evolution of cosmic ray and solar activity cycles is studied. We also discuss the heliospheric conditions responsible for the unusual behavior of cosmic ray modulation in the descending phase of cycle 20.},

The loops for cycles 19 and 21 are broad ovals whereas those for cycles 20 and 22 are nearly flat. A complementary feature of the data is that the cosmic ray intensity decreases more rapidly as the sunspot number increases following solar activity minima when the solar polar magnetic parameter A is negative than when A is positive. It is argued that these facts give some support to including gradient and curvature drifts in theories of the transport of cosmic rays in the heliosphere.

Computational seismic holography is accomplished by the phase-coherent wave-mechanical reconstruction of the p-mode acoustic field into the solar interior based on helioseismic observations at the solar surface. It treats the acoustic field at the solar surface in a way broadly analogous to how the eye treats
electromagnetic radiation at the surface of the cornea,
wave-mechanically refocusing radiation from submerged sources to render stigmatic images that can be sampled over focal surfaces at any desired depth. Holographic diagnostics offer a straight-forward assessment of the informational content of the observed p-mode spectrum independent of prospective physical models of the local interior anomalies that it represents. Computational holography was proposed as the optimum approach whereby to address the severe diffraction effects that confront standard tomography in the solar p-mode environment. It has given us a number of remarkable discoveries in the last two years and now promises a new insight into solar interior structure and dynamics in the local perspective. We compare the diagnostic roles of simple acoustic-power holography and phase-sensitive holography, and anticipate approaches to solar interior modeling based on holographic signatures. We identify simple computational principles that, applied to high-quality
helioseismic observations, make it easy for prospective analysts to produce high-quality holographic images for practical applications in local helioseismology.},

	abstract = {We describe the basic principles of ``helioseismic holography,'' an analytic technique intended for local helioseismology of subsurface structure. The purpose of this technique is to provide depth
discrimination of subsurface structure that manifests a surface
signature in acoustic waves. It is based on the computational
application of spatially resolved helioseismic observations to the surface of an acoustic model of the solar interior that contains no local structure. The observed surface oscillations are applied to the model in time reverse, and the model is then computationally sampled at various depths in its interior. This technique takes advantage of the coherence retained by waves in a smooth acoustic medium following an interaction with subsurface structure, allowing us to extrapolate the acoustic field with high accuracy to the depth where the structure lies. Depth discrimination is then accomplished by focus-defocus diagnostics.

We describe computational approaches to the technique from two different perspectives, the ``spectral'' and the ``spatial.'' For rigorous models of the solar interior, the computational demands of the spectral and spatial approaches are approximately the same. For diagnostics of relatively shallow structure, the plane-parallel approximation of the model is useful. In this case the spectral approach reduces
computational holography essentially to Fourier transforms, which can be performed rapidly with very modest hardware. We illustrate the technique in this case, using artificial data characterizing waves in an idealized plane-parallel medium with acoustic absorbers located at various depths.

At present, we prefer to maintain a secure distinction between
holography and modeling. While we do not discuss modeling in this paper, we think that it is important to develop an approach to modeling that takes advantage of holographic reconstruction. The prospect of viewing local subsurface magnetic regions and flows opens an entirely new dimension to helioseismology and to solar and stellar physics in general. It may make it possible to anticipate solar activity far in advance of its emergence to the surface. Local acoustic diagnostics could revolutionize our understanding of the solar dynamo and the 22 yr activity cycle.},

To test the reliability of this technique, the helioseismically inferred active region detections are compared with far-side observations of solar activity from the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO), using brightness in extreme-ultraviolet light (EUV) as a proxy for magnetic fields. Two approaches are used to analyze nine months of STEREO and HMI data. In the first approach, we determine whether new large east-limb active regions are detected seismically on the far side before they appear Earth side and study how the detectability of these regions relates to their EUV intensity. We find that while there is a range of EUV intensities for which far-side regions may or may not be detected seismically, there appears to be an intensity level above which they are almost always detected and an intensity level below which they are never detected. In the second approach, we analyze concurrent extreme-ultraviolet and helioseismic far-side observations. We find that 100\% (22) of the far-side seismic regions correspond to an extreme-ultraviolet plage; 95\% of these either became a NOAA-designated magnetic region when reaching the east limb or were one before crossing to the far side. A low but significant correlation is found between the seismic signature strength and the EUV intensity of a far-side region.},

	abstract = {Cosmic ray Forbush effects (FEs) have been studied for more than 60 years, but even today this phenomenon has no universally accepted definition, which leads to misunderstanding among researchers. There are no complete and convincing answers to the following questions: What are the distinctive features of FEs? What determines the magnitude of FEs and their variety? How are FEs associated with disturbances of the interplanetary medium, coronal mass ejections and high speed flows of the solar wind? What relation exists between FEs and geomagnetic storms? In order to answer these and other questions a data base of transient effects in cosmic rays and in the interplanetary medium is constructed and is being upgraded continuously. It combines variations in cosmic ray densities and anisotropies obtained from data of the world-wide neutron monitor (NM) network, characteristics of solar wind disturbances, solar and geomagnetic data. This data base presently contains more than 1400 events, observed during 1978–1996. The preliminary analysis allowed us to get the main characteristics of FEs, to determine what distinguishes this phenomenon among other cosmic ray variations, and propose a definition of the Forbush effect. In addition, an interplanetary disturbance parameter was derived, which is most closely associated with the magnitude of a FE. Using this large observational database, a relation between FEs and geomagnetic activity was analyzed statistically as a dependence of the FE magnitude on the maximum Kp-index measured during the associated magnetic storm.},

	abstract = {The "official" list (http://gle.oulu.fi) of ground-level enhancements (GLE) of the count rate of a neutron monitor (NM), caused by solar energetic particles, plays an important role in solar and solar-terrestrial studies. The list is based on the classical GLE definition, which assumes that the event should be registered by at least two differently located NMs regardless to their atmospheric and geomagnetic cutoff properties. Until 2015 there was only one long-operating NM at a high-altitude polar site with the reduced total cutoff (SOPO/B at the Amundsen-Scott station, South Pole, Antarctica, elevation 2835 m asl), and Vostok NM (Vostok station, 3500 m) operating 1963-1969. Accordingly, most of the registered GLEs included data from at least one NM near the sea level. However, another high-altitude polar NM (DOMC/B) had been installed in 2015 at Concordia station (Dome C, Antarctica, elevation 3233 m asl) and is in continuous operation since then. As a result, this pair of exceptionally sensitive instruments (SOPO/B and DOMC/B) can formally register a GLE from a relatively weak SEP event below the full atmospheric cutoff, which would have not been detected at any other NM station and, accordingly, not accepted as a GLE before 2015. This would potentially distort the homogeneity of the present GLE list by more frequent detections due to the enhanced sensitivity of the global NM network. In order to maintain the homogeneity, we propose to modify the presently used GLE as follows: " A GLE event is registered when there are near-time coincident and statistically significant enhancements of the count rates of at least two differently located neutron monitors, including at least one neutron monitor near sea level and a corresponding enhancement in the proton flux measured by a space-borne instrument(s)." We also propose to classify SEP events under the full atmospheric cutoff, which are seen only in data of high-altitude polar NMs, as sub-GLEs. We note that this definition does not affect the present list of GLEs.},

This pattern is distorted by the interaction of fast and slow solar wind streams, as well as the interplanetary manifestations of transient solar eruptions called coronal mass ejections. On the smaller scale, the HMF exhibits an array of waves, discontinuities, and turbulence, which give hints to the solar wind formation process. This review aims to summarise observations and theory of the small- and large-scale structure of the HMF. Solar-cycle and cycle-to-cycle evolution of the HMF is discussed in terms of recent spacecraft observations and pre-spaceage proxies for the HMF in geomagnetic and galactic cosmic ray records.},

	abstract = {A “Solar Dynamo” (SODA) Index prediction of the amplitude of Solar Cycle 25 is described. The SODA Index combines values of the solar polar magnetic field and the solar spectral irradiance at 10.7 cm to create a precursor of future solar activity. The result is an envelope of solar activity that minimizes the 11-year period of the sunspot cycle. We show that the variation in time of the SODA Index is similar to several wavelet transforms of the solar spectral irradiance at 10.7 cm. Polar field predictions for Solar Cycles 21 – 24 are used to show the success of the polar field precursor in previous sunspot cycles. Using the present value of the SODA index, we estimate that the next cycle’s smoothed peak activity will be about 140±30140±30140 {\textbackslash}pm30 solar flux units for the 10.7 cm radio flux and a Version 2 sunspot number of 135±25135±25135 {\textbackslash}pm25. This suggests that Solar Cycle 25 will be comparable to Solar Cycle 24. The estimated peak is expected to occur near 2025.2±1.52025.2±1.52025.2 {\textbackslash}pm1.5 year. Because the current approach uses data prior to solar minimum, these estimates may improve as the upcoming solar minimum draws closer.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade there has been mounting evidence that the strength of the Sun's polar magnetic fields during a solar cycle minimum is the best predictor of the amplitude of the next solar cycle. Surface flux transport models can be used to extend these predictions by evolving the Sun's surface magnetic field to obtain an earlier prediction for the strength of the polar fields, and thus the amplitude of the next cycle. In 2016, our Advective Flux Transport (AFT) model was used to do this, producing an early prediction for Solar Cycle 25. At that time, AFT predicted that Cycle 25 will be similar in strength to the Cycle 24, with an uncertainty of about 15\% . AFT also predicted that the polar fields in the southern hemisphere would weaken in late 2016 and into 2017 before recovering. That AFT prediction was based on the magnetic field configuration at the end of January 2016. We now have 2 more years of observations. We examine the accuracy of the 2016 AFT prediction and find that the new observations track well with AFT's predictions for the last two years. We show that the southern relapse did in fact occur, though the timing was off by several months. We propose a possible cause for the southern relapse and discuss the reason for the offset in timing. Finally, we provide an updated AFT prediction for Solar Cycle 25 which includes solar observations through January of 2018.},

We report that the flows now show traces of the mid-latitude acceleration that is expected to become the main equatorward-moving branch of the zonal flow pattern for Cycle 25.

	abstract = {The heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) is the extension of the coronal magnetic field carried out into the solar system by the solar wind. It is the means by which the Sun interacts with planetary magnetospheres and channels charged particles propagating through the heliosphere. As the HMF remains rooted at the solar photosphere as the Sun rotates, the large-scale HMF traces out an Archimedean spiral. This pattern is distorted by the interaction of fast and slow solar wind streams, as well as the interplanetary manifestations of transient solar eruptions called coronal mass ejections. On the smaller scale, the HMF exhibits an array of waves, discontinuities, and turbulence, which give hints to the solar wind formation process. This review aims to summarise observations and theory of the small- and large-scale structure of the HMF. Solar-cycle and cycle-to-cycle evolution of the HMF is discussed in terms of recent spacecraft observations and pre-spaceage proxies for the HMF in geomagnetic and galactic cosmic ray records.},

The acceptances of a scintillator along the axis through the scintillators and perpendicularly on this axis follow the same distribution in theory.

Explorers 1 and 3 carried James Van Allen's Geiger counters. He had hoped to measure the lowenergy portion of the differential intensity of cosmic rays (particles with energies of hundreds of MeV of non-terrestrial origin), which could not be observed from the ground or with balloons because of atmospheric absorption. Yet the few minutes of data, received whenever the satellite was within range of the tracking station, were puzzling. At low geocentric distances of the 2500 km apogee orbit of Explorer 1 particle intensities were as expected. However, at higher altitudes the intensity dropped to zero. Explorer 3 carried a tape recorder and solved the puzzle. Again, the particle intensity or counting rate was normal at low altitudes, but then it increased rapidly until the maximum transmittable level of 128 counts/s was reached. A constant rate of 128 counts/s was observed for some time but then suddenly dropped to zero, recovering to 128 counts/s later and finally returning to normal at low altitudes. The actual counting rate was increasing rapidly far beyond the 128 counts/s limit, reaching such high rates that the Geiger counter “froze”, that is discharged so frequently that it could not properly recover between counts, yielding pulses too small to be detected by the circuitry used.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

Additionally, events may be extreme relative to one parameter but normal relative to others. In this study, we analyze several measures of the severity of space weather events (flare intensity, coronal mass ejection speeds, Dst, and {\textgreater}30 MeV proton fluences as inferred from nitrate records) to estimate the probability of occurrence of extreme events. By showing that the frequency of occurrence scales as an inverse power of the severity of the event, and assuming that this relationship holds at higher magnitudes, we are able to estimate the probability that an event larger than some criteria will occur within a certain interval of time in the future. For example, the probability of another Carrington event (based on Dst {\textless} −850 nT) occurring within the next decade is ∼12\%. We also identify and address several limitations with this approach. In particular, we assume time stationarity, and thus, the effects of long-term space climate change are not considered. While this technique cannot be used to predict specific events, it may ultimately be useful for probabilistic forecasting.},

A neutron monitor was installed for the first time in Korea at the Korea Research Institute of Standard Science in 2011 with a rigidity cutoff of 11.2 GV. The barometric coefficient and the diurnal variation were analyzed with data for the interval Dec. 1–31, 2011. A reliable barometric coefficient was determined, −0.6557 ± 0.0044\%/hPa, and the diurnal variation was observed. The Daejeon neutron monitor worked correctly, given that the diurnal variation was hard to observe when the variation was small (in this case, less than 1\%).},

	abstract = {The original design by J. A. Simpson of the neutron monitor enabled continuous monitoring of the primary cosmic-ray flux by ground-based recordings of the nucleonic component with only a rather simple correction for atmospheric effects. Simpson (1957) extended the original pile to the 12 counter IGY neutron monitor which was deployed in a world wide network during the International Geophysical Year 1957/8. The desirability for monitors with higher counting rates became evident soon afterwards. Subsequently the NM64 super neutron monitor was designed by H. Carmichael for deployment in time for the International Quiet Sun Year 1964. Using unusually large 10BF3 proportional counters made at Chalk River, Hatton and Carmichael (1964) studied comprehensively the experimental design of the NM64. Consequently the efficiency of neutron counters to record evaporation neutrons produced in the lead of a monitor increased from 1.9\% for the IGY to 5.7\% for the NM64, an increase of 3.3 times the counting rate per unit area of lead producer. During the years much attention was given to the neutron multiplicity spectrum in neutron monitors. This spectrum is related to the energy spectrum of the nucleonic component incident on the neutron monitor, but is only weakly dependent on the spectrum of galactic cosmic rays at the top of the atmosphere. Contrary to galactic cosmic rays, solar flare protons and neutrons are observed predominantly as single counts per interaction, in multiplicity 1, because of the softness of solar flare particle energy spectra. Neutron monitors have also been specially designed to record solar neutrons with increased sensitivity. Newly developed 3He counters with a largely reduced thermal neutron absorption mean free path should lead to improved efficiency in recording primary cosmic radiation. Design criteria are discussed.},

	abstract = {The passage of cosmic ray particles and energetic solar particles through interplanetary space is illustrated with a number of idealized examples. The formal examples are worked out from the condition that energetic particles in interplanetary space random walk in the irregularities in the large-scale interplanetary magnetic field. The irregularities move with approximately the velocity of the solar wind. The classical probability distribution is describable by a Fokker-Planck equation. A general expression for the particle diffusion coefficient kij is worked out, including both scattering in magnetic irregularities and systematic pressure drifts. Magnetometer data from Explorer XVIII is presented to show the close average adherence of the quiet-day interplanetary magnetic field to the theoretical spiral angle, and to show the tendency for particles to move more freely along the field than across, k∥ {\textgreater}k⊥. The observed fields show that the diffusion coefficient is of the order of 1021–1022 cm2/sec, as had been estimated from earlier cosmic ray studies. A middle value of 3 × 1021 cm2/sec suggests a cosmic ray density gradient of about 10 per cent per a.u. across the orbit of Earth. Direct observations of the interplanetary magnetic field afford the possibility for quantitative estimate of Kij as a function of particle energy. The first example to be considered is isotropic diffusion in a spherical region r {\textless} R with uniform radial wind velocity v for the purpose of illustrating the general nature and duration of the passage of a cosmic ray particle through the solar system. It is shown that the cosmic ray density reduction is of the order of exp (−vR/k), and, hence, that during the years of solar activity vR/k is not less than about 1 for protons of one BeV or so. It follows from this that the galactic cosmic ray particles will generally have spent several days in the solar system by the time they are observed. During this time they are in the expanding magnetic fields carried in the solar wind and are adiabatically decelerated, losing 15 per cent or more of their energy by the time they are observed. The energy distribution is shown for particles starting all with the same energy T0 from interstellar space. The incoming probability wave of a single particle is computed as a function of time, showing how the particle is swept back by the wind. The converse problem of energetic solar particles is illustrated. The solar particles may typically lose half their initial energy before escaping into interstellar space. The outward motion of the wind displaces their probability distribution outward so that ultimately the maximum solar particle intensity may lie beyond the orbit of Earth. The outward motion of the wind steepens the decline of the solar particle intensity. The steady-state cosmic ray intensity is calculated throughout the spherical region r {\textless} R supposing a uniform cosmic ray density N0 to obtain in interstellar space. The calculation is carried out for isotropic Kij, which would obtain if the magnetic irregularities were of large amplitude and of a scale not exceeding the radius of gyration of the cosmic ray particles, and for anisotropic kij with k∥ ⪢ k⊥, which obtains when the field is relatively smooth. (The observations at sunspot minimum suggest k∥ ⪢ k⊥ at the orbit of Earth.) The particles diffuse only along the spiral lines of force when k∥ ⪢ k⊥, so their path in and out of the solar system is much longer than when Kij is isotropic. The result is a much greater reduction of the cosmic ray intensity for a given vR/{\textbar}Kij{\textbar}. There is no direct observational information on Kij beyond the orbit of Earth, where the intensity reduction takes place. Indirect information is available, however. There is the fact that the intensity of energetic solar particles at Earth often decays as t−g with g = 1·5–2·0. It is shown that in order for this to follow, it is necessary that {\textbar}Kij{\textbar} ∞ rs with s = 0·0–0·5 if kij is isotropic, and s = 2·0–2·5 if k∥ ⪢ k⊥. That is to say, if Kij should continue to be as anisotropic beyond Earth as it is observed to be near Earth, then the diffusion must increase rapidly with distance from the Sun. These qualitative features should be easily detectable with particle, field, and plasma observations beyond the orbit of Earth.

	abstract = {High-energy particles are extragalactic
Cosmic rays are high-energy particles arriving from space; some have energies far beyond those that human-made particle accelerators can achieve. The sources of higher-energy cosmic rays remain under debate, although we know that lower-energy cosmic rays come from the solar wind. The Pierre Auger Collaboration reports the observation of thousands of cosmic rays with ultrahigh energies of several exa–electron volts (about a Joule per particle), arriving in a slightly dipolar distribution (see the Perspective by Gallagher and Halzen). The direction of the rays indicates that the particles originated in other galaxies and not from nearby sources within our own Milky Way Galaxy.
Science, this issue p. 1266; see also p. 1240
Cosmic rays are atomic nuclei arriving from outer space that reach the highest energies observed in nature. Clues to their origin come from studying the distribution of their arrival directions. Using 3 × 104 cosmic rays with energies above 8 × 1018 electron volts, recorded with the Pierre Auger Observatory from a total exposure of 76,800 km2 sr year, we determined the existence of anisotropy in arrival directions. The anisotropy, detected at more than a 5.2σ level of significance, can be described by a dipole with an amplitude of {\textless}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/highwire/sci/357/6357/1266/embed/mml-math-1.gif"/{\textgreater} percent toward right ascension αd = 100 ± 10 degrees and declination δd = {\textless}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/highwire/sci/357/6357/1266/embed/mml-math-2.gif"/{\textgreater} degrees.

These periods consist of two epochs each of negative and positive polarities of the heliospheric magnetic field from the north polar region of the Sun. In addition to cosmic ray data, we utilize simultaneous solar and interplanetary plasma/field data including the tilt angle of the heliospheric current sheet. We study the relation between simultaneous variations in cosmic ray intensity and solar/interplanetary parameters during the declining and the minimum phases of cycle 23. We compare these relations with those obtained for the same phases in the three previous solar cycles. We observe certain peculiar features in cosmic ray modulation during the minimum of solar cycle 23 including the record high GCR intensity. We find, during this unusual minimum, that the correlation of GCR intensity is poor with sunspot number (R = -0.41), better with interplanetary magnetic field (R = -0.66), still better with solar wind velocity (R = -0.80) and much better with the tilt angle of the heliospheric current sheet (R = -0.92). In our view, it is not the diffusion or the drift alone, but the solar wind convection is the most likely additional effect responsible for the record high GCR intensity observed during the deep minimum of solar cycle 23.},

The SSN have maintained its minimum level exceptionally for a long period (July 2008–Aug. 2009) of time. The intensity of galactic cosmic rays measured by ground based detectors is the highest ever recorded by Oulu NM since April 1964 during the recent solar minimum. Furthermore, the maximum value of SSN is found to be very low in the present cycle in comparison to previous solar cycles (19–23). The correlation coefficient between SSN and CRI without and with time-lag as well as regression analysis during the solar cycle 24 (Jan. 2008–Dec. 2015) has been estimated and compared with previous solar cycle. Based on the maximum value of correlation coefficient, the time-lag during present solar cycle is found to be 4 and 10 months for both the stations, while it is 13–14 months during cycle 23. The behaviour of running cross correlation function has also been examined during present solar cycle and it is found that it attains its maximum value {\textasciitilde}−0.8 to {\textasciitilde}−0.9 for a long duration in comparison to previous cycles. The variation of SSN and SSA has also been compared and found that they are highly correlated to each other (r {\textgreater} .92) for both the cycles. In the light of exceptional behaviour of solar cycle 24, the trend of cosmic ray modulation has been discussed and compared with earlier cycles.},

Both the recurrent plot in Bartels form and the continuous wavelet transformation analysis show the existence of rotational modulation in the variation of the daily SMMF. The dependence of the rotational cycle lengths on solar cycle phase is also studied, which indicates that the yearly mean rotational cycle lengths generally seem to be longer during the rising phase of solar cycles and shorter during the declining phase. The mean rotational cycle length for the rising phase of all of the solar cycles in the considered time is 28.28 ± 0.67 days, while for the declining phase it is 27.32 ± 0.64 days. The difference of the mean rotational cycle lengths between the rising phase and the declining phase is 0.96 days. The periodicity analysis, through the use of an auto-correlation function, indicates that the rotational cycle lengths have a significant period of about 10.1 years. Furthermore, the cross-correlation analysis indicates that there exists a phase difference between the rotational cycle lengths and solar activity.},

Some places are exceptionally well suitable for ground-based detection of SEP – high-elevation polar regions with negligible geomagnetic and reduced atmospheric energy/rigidity cutoffs. At present, there are two neutron-monitor stations in such locations on the Antarctic plateau: SOPO/SOPB (at Amundsen–Scott station, 2835 m elevation), and DOMC/DOMB (at Concordia station, 3233 m elevation). Since 2015, when the DOMC/DOMB station started continuous operation, a relatively weak SEP event that was not detected by sea-level neutron-monitor stations was registered by both SOPO/SOPB and DOMC/DOMB, and it was accordingly classified as a GLE. This would lead to a distortion of the homogeneity of the historic GLE list and the corresponding statistics. To address this issue, we propose to modify the GLE definition so that it maintains the homogeneity: A GLE event is registered when there are near-time coincident and statistically significant enhancements of the count rates of at least two differently located neutron monitors, including at least one neutron monitor near sea level and a corresponding enhancement in the proton flux measured by a space-borne instrument(s). Relatively weak SEP events registered only by high-altitude polar neutron monitors, but with no response from cosmic-ray stations at sea level, can be classified as sub-GLEs.},

It has been shown that long-term variations of the tropospheric ionization are not spatially homogeneous, and they are defined not only by solar (i.e., covariant with solar irradiance) changes but also by the geomagnetic field. The dominance of the two effects is geographically separated, which makes it possible to distinguish between direct and indirect solar-terrestrial climate effects.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03922},
	abstract = {One peculiar feature of the solar cycle which is yet to be understood properly is the frequent occurrence of double peaks (also known as the Gnevyshev peaks). Not only the double peaks but also multiple peaks and spikes are often observed in any phase of the cycle. We propose that these peaks and spikes are generated due to fluctuations in the Babcock-Leighton process (the poloidal field generation from tilted bipolar magnetic regions). When the polar field develops, large negative fluctuations in the Babcock-Leighton process can reduce the net polar field abruptly. As these fluctuations in the polar field are propagated to the new toroidal field, these can promote double peaks in the next solar cycle. When fluctuations in the polar field occur outside the solar maximum, we observe their effects as spikes or dips in the following sunspot cycle. Using an axisymmetric Babcock-Leighton dynamo model we first demonstrate this idea. Later, we perform a long simulation by including random scatter in the poloidal field generation process and successfully reproduce the double-peaked solar cycles. These results are robust under reasonable changes in the model parameters as long as the diffusivity is not too larger than \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. Finally, we analyze the observed polar field data to show a close connection between the short-term fluctuations in the polar field and the double peaks/spikes in the next cycle. Thereby, this supports our theoretical idea that the fluctuations in the Babcock-Leighton process can be responsible for the double peaks/spikes in the observed solar cycle.},

	abstract = {Magnetic clouds (MCs) are transient magnetic structures giving the strongest southward magnetic field (Bz south) in the solar wind. The sheath regions of MCs may also carry southward magnetic field. Southward magnetic field is responsible for causing space weather disturbances. We report a comprehensive analysis of MCs and Bz components in their sheath regions during 1995-2017. Eighty-five percent of 303 MCs contain a south Bz up to 50 nT. Sheath Bz during the 23 years may reach as high as 40 nT. The MCs of strongest magnetic magnitude and Bz south occur in the declining phase of the solar cycle. The bipolar MCs have solar cycle dependence in their polarity, but not in the occurrence frequency. Unipolar MCs show solar cycle dependence in their occurrence frequency but not in their polarity. MCs with the highest speeds, largest total B magnitudes and sheath Bz south are from source regions closer to the solar disk center. About 80\% of large Dst storms are caused by MC events. The combinations of south Bz in the sheath and the south-first MCs in close succession have given the largest storms. The solar cycle dependence of bipolar MCs is extended to 2017, spanning 42 years. We find that the bipolar MC Bz polarity solar cycle dependence is given by MCs originated from quiescent filaments in decayed active regions and a group of weak MCs of unclear sources, while the polarity of bipolar MCs with active region flares always has mixed Bz polarity without solar cycle dependence and therefore the least predictable for Bz forecasting.},

	abstract = {The analysis of cosmic ray intensity variation seen by muon detectors at Earth's surface can help us to understand astrophysical, solar, interplanetary and geomagnetic phenomena. However, before comparing cosmic ray intensity variations with extraterrestrial phenomena, it is necessary to take into account atmospheric effects such as the temperature effect. In this work, we analyzed this effect on the Global Muon Detector Network (GMDN), which is composed of four ground-based detectors, two in the northern hemisphere and two in the southern hemisphere. In general, we found a higher temperature influence on detectors located in the northern hemisphere. Besides that, we noticed that the seasonal temperature variation observed at the ground and at the altitude of maximum muon production are in antiphase for all GMDN locations (low-latitude regions). In this way, contrary to what is expected in high-latitude regions, the ground muon intensity decrease occurring during summertime would be related to both parts of the temperature effect (the negative and the positive). We analyzed several methods to describe the temperature effect on cosmic ray intensity. We found that the mass weighted method is the one that best reproduces the seasonal cosmic ray variation observed by the GMDN detectors and allows the highest correlation with long-term variation of the cosmic ray intensity seen by neutron monitors.},

	abstract = {The solar mean magnetic field (SMMF) is referred to as the disc-averaged line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic field that also reflects the polarity imbalance of the magnetic field on the Sun. The origin of the SMMF has been debated over the past few decades, with one school of thought suggesting that the contribution to the SMMF is mostly due to the large scale magnetic field structure, also termed as the background magnetic field, whereas other and more recent studies have indicated that active regions have a major contribution to the observed SMMF. In this paper, we re-investigate the issue of the origin of the SMMF by decomposing the solar disk into plages, networks, sunspots and background regions, thereby calculating the variation in the observed SMMF due to each of these features. We have used full disk images from SDO/\{{\textbackslash}it AIA\} recorded at 1600{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}AA{\textbackslash}, for earmarking plages, networks and background regions and 4500{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}AA{\textbackslash}, images for separating the sunspots. The LOS fields corresponding to each of these regions are estimated from the co-temporal SDO/\{{\textbackslash}it HMI\} full disk magnetograms. The temporal variation of the SMMF shows a near one-to-one correspondence with that of the background field regions suggesting that they constitute the major component of the observed SMMF. A linear regression analysis based on the coefficient of determination shows that the background field dominates, and accounts for 89{\textbackslash}\% of the variation in the SMMF whereas the magnetic field from the other features accounts for the rest 11{\textbackslash}\%.},

	abstract = {Predicting the peak amplitude of the sunspot cycle is a key goal of solar-terrestrial physics. The precursor method currently favored for such predictions is based on the dynamo model in which large-scale polar fields on the decline of the 11-year solar cycle are converted to toroidal (sunspot) fields during the subsequent cycle. The strength of the polar fields during the decay of one cycle is assumed to be an indicator of peak sunspot activity for the following cycle. Polar fields reach their peak amplitude several years after sunspot maximum; the time of peak strength is signaled by the onset of a strong annual modulation of polar fields due to the 7° tilt of the solar equator to the ecliptic plane. Using direct polar field measurements, now available for four solar cycles, we predict that the approaching solar cycle 24 (∼2011 maximum) will have a peak smoothed monthly sunspot number of 75 ± 8, making it potentially the smallest cycle in the last 100 years.},

However, in the even cycles, the loops are not narrow throughout the whole cycle; around the sunspot-maximum period, a broad loop is seen. Only in the rising and declining phases, the loops are narrow in even cycles. The CR modulation is known to have a delay with respect to RZ, and the delay was believed to be longer in odd cycles (19, 21, and 23; about 10 months) than the delay in even cycles (20 and 22; about 3 – 5 months). When this was reexamined, it was found that the delays are different during the sunspot-minimum periods (2, 6, and 14 months for odd cycles and 7 and 9 months for even cycles) and sunspot-maximum periods (0, 4, and 7 months for odd cycles and 5 and 8 months for even cycles). Thus, the differences between odd and even cycles are not signiﬁcant throughout the whole cycle. In the recent even cycle 24, hysteresis plots show a preliminary broadening near the sunspot maximum, which occurred recently (February 2012). The CR level (recorded at Newark station) is still high in 2013, indicating a long lag (exceeding 10 months) with respect to the sunspot maximum.},

In previous works a number of different indices such as the sunspot number, the CME-index, the interplanetary magnetic field and the heliospheric current sheet tilt were selected to be the most appropriate ones in order to describe the cosmic ray intensity of 10 GV observed by the network of neutron monitors. The new approach is an extension of this study to the influence of the solar magnetic field parameters, such as the mean magnetic field and the polar magnetic field, on the cosmic ray (CR) modulations. Using the wavelet analysis method a major periodicity of about 20-21 years was confirmed in the solar magnetic field data, indicating the existence of the solar magnetic cycle in CR variations. The best empirical relation of the cosmic ray modulation taking into account the sunspot number, the CME-index, the mean solar magnetic field and the solar polar field was improved significantly: a relative root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the observed and the calculated cosmic ray intensity values is found to be 8.7\% instead to the previous one of about 10\%.},

	abstract = {The last solar minimum was, by recent standards, unusually deep and long. We are now close to the maximum of the subsequent solar cycle, which is relatively weak. In this article we make comparisons between different global (unresolved) measures of the Sun’s magnetic activity to investigate how they are responding to this weak-activity epoch. We focus on helioseismic data, which are sensitive to conditions, including the characteristics of the magnetic field, in the solar interior. Also considered are measures of the magnetic field in the photosphere (sunspot number and sunspot area), the chromosphere and corona (10.7 cm radio flux and 530.3 nm green coronal index), and two measures of the Sun’s magnetic activity closer to Earth (the interplanetary magnetic field and the galactic cosmic-ray intensity). Scaled versions of the activity proxies diverge from the helioseismic data around 2000, indicating a change in relationship between the proxies. The degree of divergence varies from proxy to proxy, with sunspot area and 10.7 cm flux showing only small deviations, while sunspot number, coronal index, and the two interplanetary proxies show much larger departures. In Cycle 24 the deviations in the solar proxies and the helioseismic data decrease, raising the possibility that the deviations observed in Cycle 23 are just symptomatic of a 22-year Hale cycle. However, the deviations in the helioseismic data and the interplanetary proxies increase in Cycle 24. Interestingly, the divergence in the solar proxies and the helioseismic data are not reflected in the shorter-term variations (often referred to as quasi-biennial oscillations) observed on top of the dominant 11-year solar cycle. However, despite being highly correlated in Cycle 22, the short-term variations in the interplanetary proxies show very little correlation with the helioseismic data during Cycles 23 and 24.},

  The cross-correlation is similar in nature to the convolution of two functions.  In an autocorrelation, which is the cross-correlation of a signal with itself, there will always be a peak at a lag of zero, and its size will be the signal energy.
In probability and statistics, the term cross-correlations is used for referring to the correlations between the entries of two random vectors X and Y, while the correlations of a random vector X are considered to be the correlations between the entries of X itself, those forming the correlation matrix (matrix of correlations) of X. If each of X and Y is a scalar random variable which is realized repeatedly in temporal sequence (a time series), then the correlations of the various temporal instances of X are known as autocorrelations of X, and the cross-correlations of X with Y across time are temporal cross-correlations.
Furthermore, in probability and statistics the definition of correlation always includes a standardising factor in such a way that correlations have values between −1 and +1.

	abstract = {Is Solar Cycle 24 anomalous? How do we predict the main features of a forthcoming cycle? In order to reply such questions, this work partitions quantitatively each cycle into valley, ascend, peak, and descend phases, statistically investigate the correlations between valley phase and the forthcoming cycle. We find that the preceding valley phase may dominate and can be predictor of the forthcoming cycle: (1) The growth rate in ascend phase strongly negatively correlates to valley length and strongly positively correlates to cycle maximum. (2) The cycle maximum strongly negatively correlates to valley length, and strongly positively correlates to cycle minimum. (3) The cycle period strongly negatively correlates to the valley variation. Based on these correlations, we conclude that the solar cycle 24 is a relatively weak and long cycle which is obviously weaker than Cycle 23. The similarity analysis also presents the similar result. The Cycle 25 is also inferred possibly to be a weak cycle. These results can help us understanding the physical processes of solar cycles.},

	abstract = {The solar modulation effect of cosmic rays in the heliosphere is an energy-, time-, and particle-dependent phenomenon which arises from a combination of basic particle transport processes such as diffusion, convection, adiabatic cooling, and drift motion. Making use of a large collection of time-resolved cosmic-ray data from recent space missions, we construct a simple predictive model of solar modulation which depends on direct solar-physics inputs: the number of solar sunspots and the tilt angle of the heliospheric current sheet. Under this framework, we present calculations of cosmic-ray proton spectra, positron/electron and antiproton/proton ratios and their time dependence in connection with the evolving solar activity. We report evidence for a time-lag \${\textbackslash}Delta\{T\}=8.1{\textbackslash}pm{\textbackslash},1.2\$ months, between solar activity data and cosmic-ray flux measurements in space, which reflects the dynamics of the formation of the modulation region. This result enables us to forecast the cosmic-ray flux near Earth well in advance by monitoring solar activity},

	abstract = {As each solar cycle progresses, remnant magnetic flux from active regions (ARs) migrates poleward to cancel the old-cycle polar field. We describe this polarity reversal process during Cycle 24 using four years (2010.33-2014.33) of line-of-sight magnetic field measurements from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. The total flux associated with ARs reached maximum in the north in 2011, more than two years earlier than the south; the maximum is significantly weaker than Cycle 23. The process of polar field reversal is relatively slow, north-south asymmetric, and episodic. We estimate that the global axial dipole changed sign in 2013 October; the northern and southern polar fields (mean above 60° latitude) reversed in 2012 November and 2014 March, respectively, about 16 months apart. Notably, the poleward surges of flux in each hemisphere alternated in polarity, giving rise to multiple reversals in the north. We show that the surges of the trailing sunspot polarity tend to correspond to normal mean AR tilt, higher total AR flux, or slower mid-latitude near-surface meridional flow, while exceptions occur during low magnetic activity. In particular, the AR flux and the mid-latitude poleward flow speed exhibit a clear anti-correlation. We discuss how these features can be explained in a surface flux transport process that includes a field-dependent converging flow toward the ARs, a characteristic that may contribute to solar cycle variability.},

An updated Babcock-Leighton-type dynamo model with weak driving as indicated by stellar observations shows an excited dipole mode and a damped quadrupole mode in the correct range of periods. Random excitation of the quadrupole by stochastic fluctuations of the source term for the poloidal field leads to a time evolution of activity and asymmetry that is consistent with the observational results.},

	abstract = {Despite the significant progress achieved in recent years, the physical mechanisms underlying the origin of solar energetic particles (SEPs) are still a matter of debate. The complex nature of both particle acceleration and transport poses challenges to developing a universal picture of SEP events that encompasses both the low-energy (from tens of keV to a few hundreds of MeV) observations made by space-based instruments and the GeV particles detected by the worldwide network of neutron monitors in ground-level enhancements (GLEs). The high-precision data collected by the Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) satellite experiment offer a unique opportunity to study the SEP fluxes between \${\textbackslash}sim\$80 MeV and a few GeV, significantly improving the characterization of the most energetic events. In particular, PAMELA can measure for the first time with good accuracy the spectral features at moderate and high energies, providing important constraints for current SEP models. In addition, the PAMELA observations allow the relationship between low and high-energy particles to be investigated, enabling a clearer view of the SEP origin. No qualitative distinction between the spectral shapes of GLE, sub-GLE and non-GLE events is observed, suggesting that GLEs are not a separate class, but are the subset of a continuous distribution of SEP events that are more intense at high energies. While the spectral forms found are to be consistent with diffusive shock acceleration theory, which predicts spectral rollovers at high energies that are attributed to particles escaping the shock region during acceleration, further work is required to explore the relative influences of acceleration and transport processes on SEP spectra.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10153},
	abstract = {Aims. Lunar soil and rocks are not protected by a magnetic field or an atmosphere and are continuously irradiated by energetic particles that can produce cosmogenic radioisotopes directly inside rocks at different depths depending on the particle's energy. This allows the mean fluxes of solar and galactic cosmic rays to be assessed on the very long timescales of millions of years. Methods. Here we show that lunar rocks can serve as a very good particle integral spectrometer in the energy range 20-80 MeV. We have developed a new method based on precise modeling, that is applied to measurements of \${\textasciicircum}\{26\}\$Al (half-life {\textasciitilde}0.7 megayears) in lunar samples from the Apollo mission, and present the first direct reconstruction (i.e., without any a priori assumptions) of the mean energy spectrum of solar and galactic energetic particles over a million of years. Results. We show that the reconstructed spectrum of solar energetic particles is totally consistent with that over the last decades, despite the very different levels of solar modulation of galactic cosmic rays (\${\textbackslash}phi=496{\textbackslash}pm 40\$ MV over a million years versus \${\textbackslash}phi= 660{\textbackslash}pm 20\$ MV for the modern epoch). We also estimated the occurrence probability of extreme solar events and argue that no events with the F({\textgreater}30 MeV) fluence exceeding \$5*10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ and \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$ are expected on timescales of a thousand and million years, respectively. Conclusions. We conclude that the mean flux of solar energetic particles hardly depends on the level of solar activity, in contrast to the solar modulation of galactic cosmic rays. This puts new observational constraints on solar physics and becomes important for assessing radiation hazards for the planned space missions.},

The reconstruction is based on data from six standard NM64-type neutron monitors (Apatity, Inuvik, Kergulen, Moscow, Newark and Oulu) since 1965, and two IGY-type ground-based detectors (Climax and Mt.Washington) for 1951-1964. The new reconstruction, along with the estimated uncertainties is tabulated in the paper. The presented series forms a benchmark record of the cosmic ray variability (in the energy range between 1-30 GeV) for the last 60 years, and can be used in long-term studies in the fields of solar, heliospheric and solar-terrestrial physics.},

Random perturbations of ideal Lorentz profiles L(a nu \_i) can provide many estimations of the set of p-modes parameters a and allow one to estimate statistical error-bars sigma\_ \{a\} by modelling the parameters' distribution function. Unlike frequencies, which show symmetric distributions, amplitudes and linewidths have asymmetric probability density function similar to the distribution function for time-averaged energies of stochastically excited solar p-modes (Kumar, 1988). A comparison between sigma\_ ν and uncertainties based on Hessian's computation (Libbrecht 1992, Toutain and Appourchaux 1994) shows a nice agreement. However, our error-bars take into account more statistical effects, and rely less on the initial parameters' estimation. Such a technique has been used on the IRIS power spectra computed from gapped data, and on one GONG power spectrum computed from almost continuous data. We also present IRIS linewidths and error bars averaged over the years 1989-92 and computed with a fitting strategy using imposed frequency which improves the value of both the parameter and its uncertainty.},

The inversions also show flux cancellation rates of 1014–1015 Mx s−1 and temperature enhancements of 200 K at the detection footpoints. We investigate the near-simultaneous flaring of EBs due to co-temporal flux emergence from a sunspot, which shows a decrease in transverse velocity when interacting with an existing, stationary area of opposite polarity magnetic flux, resulting in the formation of the EBs. We also show that these EBs can be fueled further by additional, faster moving, negative magnetic flux regions.},

This paper reports measurements of the polar fields made at the Stanford Solar Observatory using the Fe I line at 525.02 nm. It is found that the average flux density poleward of 55 deg latitude is about 0.6 mT peaking to more than 1 mT at the pole and decreasing to 0.2 mT at the polar cap boundary. The total open flux through either polar cap thus becomes about 3 x 10 to the 14th Wb. It is also shown that observed magnetic field strengths vary as the

The line profiles were studied using the Mt. Wilson Observatory, the Advanced Stokes Polarimeter and the Kitt Peak-McMath Pierce telescope and one-meter Fourier transform spectrometer atlas. Both Fe I and Ni I profiles have clean continua and no blends that threaten instrument performance. The Fe I line is 2\% deeper, 15\% narrower, and has a 6\% smaller equivalent width than the Ni I line. The potential of each spectral line to recover pre-assigned solar conditions is tested using a least-squares minimization technique to fit Milne-Eddington models to tens of thousands of line profiles that have been sampled at five spectral positions across the line. Overall, the Fe I line has a better performance than the Ni I line for vector-magnetic-field retrieval. Specifically, the Fe I line is able to determine field strength, longitudinal and transverse flux four times more accurately than the Ni I line in active regions. Inclination and azimuthal angles can be recovered to ≈2° above 600 Mx cm−2 for Fe I and above 1000 Mx cm−2 for Ni I. Therefore, the Fe I line better determines the magnetic-field orientation in plage, whereas both lines provide good orientation determination in penumbrae and umbrae. We selected the Fe I spectral line for use in HMI due to its better performance for magnetic diagnostics while not sacrificing velocity information. The one exception to the better performance of the Fe I line arises when high field strengths combine with high velocities to move the spectral line beyond the effective sampling range. The higher g eff of Fe I means that its useful range of velocity values in regions of strong magnetic field is smaller than Ni I.},

	abstract = {Quantitative helioseismology and asteroseismology require very precise measurements of the frequencies, amplitudes, and lifetimes of the global modes of stellar oscillation. The precision of these measurements depends on the total length (T), quality, and completeness of the observations. Except in a few simple cases, the effect of gaps in the data on measurement precision is poorly understood, in particular in Fourier space where the convolution of the observable with the observation window introduces correlations between different frequencies. Here we describe and implement a rather general method to retrieve maximum likelihood estimates of the oscillation parameters, taking into account the proper statistics of the observations. Our fitting method applies in complex Fourier space and exploits the phase information. We consider both solar-like stochastic oscillations and long-lived harmonic oscillations, plus random noise. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the existence of cases for which our improved fitting method is less biased and has a greater precision than when the frequency correlations are ignored. This is especially true of low signal-to-noise solar-like oscillations. For example, we discuss a case where the precision of the mode frequency estimate is increased by a factor of five, for a duty cycle of 15\%. In the case of long-lived sinusoidal oscillations, a proper treatment of the frequency correlations does not provide any significant improvement; nevertheless, we confirm that the mode frequency can be measured from gapped data with a much better precision than the 1/T Rayleigh resolution.},

The time-latitude analysis of large-scale magnetic fields demonstrates cyclic changes in their zonal structure and the polar field buildup. The time-latitude distributions of the emergent and remnant magnetic flux enable us to examine individual features of recent cycles. The poleward transport of predominantly following polarities contributed much of the polar flux and led to polar field reversals. Multiple reversals of dominant polarities at the Sun’s poles were identified in Cycles 20 and 21. Triple reversals were caused by remnant flux surges of following and leading polarities. The time-latitude analysis of solar magnetic fields in Cycles 20 – 24 revealed zones that are characterized by a predominance of negative (non-Joy) tilts and by the appearance of active regions that violate Hale’s polarity law. The decay of non-Joy and anti-Hale active regions results in remnant flux surges that disturb the usual order in magnetic flux transport and sometimes lead to multiple reversals of polar fields. The analysis of local and large-scale magnetic fields and their causal relation improved our understanding of the Sun’s polar field weakening.},

	abstract = {Recent investigations on the photospheric angular velocity pattern have shown that young and short- living tracers show rotation rates higher than those determined both by older tracers and by photospheric plasma.

As a direct relationship between the age of the tracer and the angular velocity determination has been found (Zappalà \& Zuccarello
1991), it seemed very interesting to investigate whether also the "lifetime" parameter might have a role on angular velocity
determinations.

We have therefore analyzed the sunspot-group data reported in the Greenwich Photoheliographic Results during the 1874-1976 period. 9000 objects were selected as young sunspot-groups (YSG) and, using the lifetime parameter as selecting rule, we could catalogue 4463 objects having a lifetime between 2 and 10 d.

The rotation rate of these objects as a function of their lifetime was calculated and the results obtained may be summarized in the following main points:

1. Independently of their lifetime, sunspots rotate during the first 2-3 days of life in the photosphere, at a higher rate than that of recurrent sunspots.

2. Sunspots with a lifetime ranging from 2 to 8 d are more efficiently decelerated than YSG, while 11-day living sunspots are less efficiently decelerated.

3. Sunspots in the equatorial belt (0-10°) having a lifetime
comparable to that of supergranule cells, rotate slower than the cells themselves.

4. The angular velocity measured during the last day of life is lower both than that of YSG and than that deduced by sunspots which disappear the day after.

These results have been analyzed in the scenario of the sunspots cluster model ( 1987). According to the conclusions drawn, the initial higher angular velocity of young and short-living sunspots is not a function of the cluster "aggregation capability"; the rate of rise of the merging level through the convection zone is influenced by (or influences) the ability of the cluster to keep coalesced; finally, when the merging level rises too fast, the sunspot dissolves.},

	abstract = {Using data of cosmic ray muon intensities observed with the 17 directional telescopes at Nagoya during the period 1971–1988, we have studied the long-term modulation of the cosmic ray anisotropy of solar origin responsible for the solar semidiurnal variation. It is found that the 17 semidiurnal harmonic vectors suddenly change their relative configuration from a proper type to another on the harmonic dial for the polarity reversal of the polar magnetic field of the Sun from “positive” to “negative” state, which occurred in the period of 1979–1980, and the new type of the configuration has continued until now for all the negative state, even in the period of the minimum solar activity ( 1986). Using the coupling coefficients of the semidurnal variation for various rigidity spectra, it is found that such a configuration change is due to the spectrum change of the anisotropy from “soft” to “hard”. According to the diffusion-convection theory, there are two causal factors producing the hardness change, one is the change of the power exponent (δ) of the rigidity spectrum (pδ) of the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient and the other is the difference of the drift motion of cosmic rays in the positive and negative state. The former can be excluded as δ is supposed to be independent of the polarity state, although it might depend on the solar activity. While, in the latter case, the hardness change is quite reversed, depending on the value of δ greater or less than unity. The observed hardness change suggests that δ is less than unity in the rigidity region between several and several tens gigavolts for all the periods.},

	abstract = {For the first time, we statistically study the properties of ephemeral regions (ERs) and quantitatively determine their parameters at the emergence stage based on a sample of 2988 ERs observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory. During the emergence process, there are three kinds of kinematic performances, i.e., separation of dipolar patches, shift of the ER's magnetic centroid, and rotation of the ER's axis. The average emergence duration, flux emergence rate, separation velocity, shift velocity, and angular speed are 49.3 minutes, 2.6 × 1015 Mx s–1, 1.1 km s–1, 0.9 km s–1, and 0.°6 minute–1, respectively. At the end of emergence, the mean magnetic flux, separation distance, shift distance, and rotation angle are 9.3 × 1018 Mx, 4.7 Mm, 1.1 Mm, and 12.°9, respectively. We also find that the higher the ER magnetic flux is, (1) the longer the emergence lasts, (2) the higher the flux emergence rate is, (3) the further the two polarities separate, (4) the lower the separation velocity is, (5) the larger the shift distance is, (6) the slower the ER shifts, and (7) the lower the rotation speed is. However, the rotation angle seems not to depend on the magnetic flux. Not only at the start time, but also at the end time, the ERs are randomly oriented in both the northern and the southern hemispheres. Finally, neither the anti-clockwise-rotated ERs nor the clockwise rotated ones dominate the northern or the southern hemisphere.},

The two special rotation cycles of 26.6 and 28.5 days should be derived from different magnetic flux elements in the SMMF. The rotation cycle of the weak magnetic flux element in the SMMF is 26.6 days, while the rotation cycle of the strong magnetic flux element in the SMMF is 28.5 days. The two rotation periods of the structure of the interplanetary magnetic field near the ecliptic plane are essentially related to weak and strong magnetic flux elements in the SMMF, respectively. The rotation cycle of weak magnetic flux in the SMMF did not vary over the last 40 years because the weak magnetic flux element derived from the weak magnetic activity on the full disk is not influenced by latitudinal migration. Neither the internal rotation of the Sun nor the solar magnetic activity on the disk (including the solar polar fields) causes the annual variation of SMMF. The variation of SMMF at timescales of a solar cycle is more related to weak magnetic activity on the full solar disk.},

Solar, interplanetary and geomagnetic characteristic parameters of each event separately have been studied in detail and analyzed. It was shown through the usage of the “ring of neutron monitor stations” method that, in some cases, precursory signals before the main phase of the event appeared. After an extended study of the Forbush decreases precursors during the examined period, the appearance of pre-decreases and/or pre-increases of the cosmic ray intensity before the beginning of the events, acting as precursory signals, were identified in almost half of the cases studied.

	abstract = {We examine daily records of sunspot group areas (measured in millionths of a solar hemisphere or μHem) for the last 130 years to determine the rate of decay of sunspot group areas. We exclude observations of groups when they are more than 60° in longitude from the central meridian and only include data when at least three days of observations are available following the date of maximum area for a group’s disk passage. This leaves data for over 18 000 measurements of sunspot group decay. We find that the decay rate increases linearly from 28 μHem day−1 to about 140 μHem day−1 for groups with areas increasing from 35 μHem to 1000 μHem. The decay rate tends to level off for groups with areas larger than 1000 μHem. This behavior is very similar to the increase in the number of sunspots per group as the area of the group increases. Calculating the decay rate per individual sunspot gives a decay rate of about 3.65 μHem day−1 with little dependence upon the area of the group. This suggests that sunspots decay by a Fickian diffusion process with a diffusion coefficient of about 10 km2 s−1. Although the 18 000 decay rate measurements are lognormally distributed, this can be attributed to the lognormal distribution of sunspot group areas and the linear relationship between area and decay rate for the vast majority of groups. We find weak evidence for variations in decay rates from one solar cycle to another and for different phases of each sunspot cycle. However, the strongest evidence for variations is with latitude and the variations with cycle and phase of each cycle can be attributed to this variation. High latitude spots tend to decay faster than low latitude spots.},

hemisphere were identified on NSO/KP (National Observatory / Kitt Peak) full-disk magnetograms during 29 solar rotations selected from 1975 through 1986. The bipolar active regions are included only once in this sampling; their properties are derived at the time of maximum
development. In order to study an unbiased sample over the entire range of areas larger than 2.5 square degrees (or 373 sq Mm), their counts are corrected for size-dependent effects that reduce the chance of their identifications. The size distribution of bipolar active regions is a well-defined function that decreases with increasing size. Except for the smallest regions, the shape of the size distribution is independent of the phase of a cycle, only the scaling factor varies. The shape of the size distribution function for bipoles emerging within existing sunspot regions is virtually the same as that for bipoles emerging outside existing regions. Over the cycle, at least 44\% of the regions larger than 3.5 square degrees emerge within existing sunspot regions. Hence, the rate at which new regions emerge is much higher within the boundaries of existing sunspot regions than it is in the activity belts outside existing regions. For regions emerging outside of existing sunspot regions, this rate increases by a factor of 3.5 from cycle minimum to maximum, while for new bipoles within existing active regions, the emergence rate varies with a significantly lower magnitude. Through the cycle, for regions in all size bins, the emergence
frequencies appear to vary in phase. The frequencies increase by a factor of more than 8 from minimum to maximum for regions larger than 3.5 square degrees, but no more than 4.7 for the smaller regions. Short-term variations in the emergence frequency of regions do not necessarily occur simultaneously for regions of all sizes, implying that the size distribution is variable on time scales of less than six rotations.},

The principal variation of sunspots, an ∼11 yr variation, modulates the amount of the magnetic field that pierces the solar surface and drives significant variations in our star's radiative, particulate, and eruptive output over that period. This paper presents observations from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and Solar Dynamics Observatory indicating that the 11 yr sunspot variation is intrinsically tied to the spatio-temporal overlap of the activity bands belonging to the 22 yr magnetic activity cycle. Using a systematic analysis of ubiquitous coronal brightpoints and the magnetic scale on which they appear to form, we show that the landmarks of sunspot cycle 23 can be explained by considering the evolution and interaction of the overlapping activity bands of the longer-scale variability.},

	abstract = {Significant discrepancies are often observed among the values of the mean magnetic field (MMF) of the Sun as a star observed by various instruments using various spectral lines. This is conventionally attributed to the measurement errors and “saturation” of a solar magnetograph in fine-structure photospheric elements with a strong magnetic field. Measurements of the longitudinal MMF performed in 1968–2006 at six observatories are compared in this paper. It is shown that the degree of discrepancy (slopes b of linear regression lines) varies significantly over the phase of the 11-year cycle. This gives rise to a paradox: the magnetograph calibration is affected by the state of the Sun itself. The proposed explanation is based on quantum properties of light, namely, nonlocality and “coupling” of photons whose polarization at the telescope-spectrograph output is determined by spacious parts of the solar disk. In this case, the degree of coupling, or “identity,” of photons depends on the field distribution in the photosphere and the instrument design (as Bohr said, “the instrument inevitably affects the result”). The “puzzling” values of slope b are readily explained by the dependence of the coupling on the solar-cycle phase. The very statistical nature of light makes discrepancies unavoidable and requires the simple averaging of data to obtain the best approximation of the actual MMF. A 39-year time series of the MMF absolute value is presented, which is indicative of significant variations in the magnitude of the solar magnetic field with a cycle period of 10.5(7) yr.},

	abstract = {During the last 40 years, the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory and five other observatories around the world have carried out more than 18 500 (daily) measurements of the mean magnetic field (MMF) of the Sun as a star. The main MMF periodicity is due to the equatorial rotation of the Sun with a synodic period of 26.92 ± 0.02 day (it was stable for decades, but “bifurcated” in the 23rd cycle). It is shown that (a) the average sidereal period of the equator, 25.122 ± 0.010 day, is in close resonant relations with orbital and axial rotations of Mercury (5: 2 and 5: 3, respectively); (b) the most powerful long period, 1.036 ± 0.007 years, is suspiciously close to the orbital period of the Earth and (c) coincides with the average synodic period of revolution of giant planets 1.036 ± 0.020 years; and (d) MMF reveals a significant period of 1.58 ± 0.02 years, which agrees, within errors, with the synodic period of Venus (1.60 years), and (e) a significant periodicity of 19.8 ± 2.5 years probably related to the 22-year magnetic cycle of the Sun. The nature of all these periodicities is mysterious.The assumption is made that the resonances originated at the early stages of formation of the Solar System, and their existence in the modern epoch is due to the specific features of the structure and dynamics of the central core of our star. It is found that the MMF level averaged over 40 years is practically zero, −0.018 ± 0.015 G. The anomalous behavior of the 23rd cycle is pointed out; this is expressed in (1) violation of the Gnevyshev-Ohl rule for the pair of cycles 22–23, (2) accelerated rotation of the solar equator by 1.2\%, and (3) considerable increase in the cycle duration (not smaller than 11.5 years), as compared to the average cycle duration in the 20th century (11.5 years). The problem of the so called magnetic “monopole” of the Sun is briefly discussed.},

The regression coefficient b for 1054 pairs of daily values measured simultaneously on both lines equals 0.82 (a correlation coefficient is 0.94; magnetic field strengths determined by the line with λ = 525.0 nm are lower than those for the line with λ = 524.7 nm). However, the b value varied significantly along with phases of the 11-year cycle from 0.88 in 2003 to 0.49 in 2009. It is difficult to ascribe these variations to purely instrumental or solar causes. Moreover, the semiannual value of b decreased with the decrease in the absolute strength of the MMF, which contradicts the model of thin magnetic flux ropes of the photosphere. Similar behavior of b was also observed in the comparison of MMF measured at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory and Stanford by the line with λ = 525.0 nm. The inconsistency of the results obtained by these two iron lines on different instruments has been noted. It has been concluded that the variance in and odd behavior of b are predetermined not only by the instrument and the Sun (by the so-called fine structure of the photosphere field), but also by the act of measuring. When recording solar (and stellar) magnetic fields and modeling atmospheric processes, quantum effects have to be taken into account, such as nonlocality, indistinguishability, and the entanglement of photons, as well as that a photon only acquires its properties at the exact moment of its detection. The best approximation to reality can be achieved by averaging the MMF measurements carried out with different magnetographs and in different spectral lines.},

	abstract = {Over past 51 years (1968–2018) the general magnetic field of the Sun was measured nearly each day by the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory, the Wilcox Solar Observatory and five others. It is shown that the annual variation of this field (longitudinal component), thought to be caused by the inclination of the Sun’s axis to ecliptic, is splitted into two components with periods 0.954(3) years and 1.034(4) years (with mean amplitudes ≈0.044≈0.044{\textbackslash}approx 0.044 G). But while the first one agrees well with the expected period 0.957(4) years (caused by the 11-year polar field reversals and coupled to the yearly projection effect), the second one is shifted relative to its theoretical value, 1.047(4) years, by Δ=0.013(5)Δ=0.013(5){\textbackslash}Delta = 0.013(5) years (99\% confidence). The beat period of the two observed components, 12.3(7) years, agrees well with the Jovian period 11.9 years, being close also to the length of the 11-year cycle. Since the modern astronomy rejects a planetary influence on the Sun, the origin of both the 1.034-year periodicity and the shift ΔΔ{\textbackslash}Delta remains to be mysterious.},

	abstract = {The growing field of large-scale time domain astronomy requires methods for probabilistic data analysis that are computationally tractable, even with large data sets. Gaussian processes (GPs) are a popular class of models used for this purpose, but since the computational cost scales, in general, as the cube of the number of data points, their application has been limited to small data sets. In this paper, we present a novel method for GPs modeling in one dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly with the size of the data set. We demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated and real astronomical time series data sets. These demonstrations are examples of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits structure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically driven damped harmonic oscillators—providing a physical motivation for and interpretation of this choice—but we also demonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases. We present a mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing scalable GP methods. The method is fast and interpretable, with a range of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond. We provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations of this method in C++, Python, and Julia.},

In this Special Issue, we firstly discuss how magnetic fields emerge from the solar interior to the solar surface, to build up active regions, which commonly host large-scale coronal disturbances, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Then, we discuss the physical processes associated with the driving and triggering of these eruptions, the propagation of the large-scale magnetic disturbances through interplanetary space and the interaction of CMEs with Earth's magnetic field. The acceleration mechanisms for the solar energetic particles related to explosive phenomena (e.g. flares and/or CMEs) in the solar corona are also discussed. The main aim of this Issue, therefore, is to encapsulate the present state-of-the-art in research related to the genesis of solar eruptions and their space-weather implications.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Solar eruptions and their space weather impact’.},

One of the main scientific objectives of LHAASO is to precisely measure the cosmic rays energy spectrum of individual components from 1014 eV to 1018 eV. The hybrid observation will be employed by LHAASO experiment, in which the lateral and longitudinal distributions of the extensive air shower can be observed simultaneously. Thus many kinds of parameters can be used for primary nuclei identification. In this paper, high purity cosmic ray simulation samples of light nuclei component are obtained through Multi-Variable Analysis. The apertures of 1/4 LHAASO array for pure proton and mixed proton and helium (H\&He) samples are 900 m2Sr and 1800 m2Sr respectively.

	abstract = {The newly published spectra of protons and helium over time directly measured in space by the AMS-02 experiment for the period 2011--2017 provide a unique opportunity to calibrate ground-based neutron monitors (NMs). Here, calibration of several stable sealevel NMs (Inuvik, Apatity, Oulu, Newark, Moscow, Hermanus, Athens) was performed using these spectra. Four modern NM yield functions were verified: Mi13 (Mishev et al., 2013), Ma16 (Mangeard et al., 2016), CM12 (Caballero-Lopez \& Moraal, 2012) and CD00 (Clem \& Dorman, 2000), on the basis of the cosmic-ray spectra measured by AMS-02. The Mi13 yield function was found to realistically represent the NM response to galactic cosmic rays. CM12 yield function leads to a small skew in the solar cycle dependence of the scaling factor. In contrast, Ma16 and CD00 yield functions tend to overestimate the NM sensitivity to low-rigidity ({\textless}10 GV) cosmic rays. This effect may be important for an analysis of ground level enhancements, leading to a potential underestimate of fluxes of solar energetic particles as based on NM data. The Mi13 yield function is recommended for quantitative analyses of NM data, especially for ground-level enhancements. The validity the force-field approximation was studied, and it was found that it fits well the directly measured proton spectra, within a few \% for periods of low to moderate activity and up to {\textasciitilde}10\% for active periods. The results of this work strengthen and validate the method of the cosmic-ray variability analysis based on the NM data and yield-function formalism, and improves its accuracy.},

Yet these two compositions are drawn from essentially the same core collapse (CCSN) and thermonuclear (SN Ia) supernova ejecta: (Z/H)SS from unbiased accumulation over {\textasciitilde}Gyr and (Z/H)GCRS from highly biased sampling during the brief period {\textless}30 kyr of homologous early Sedov-Taylor supernova expansion that diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is most effective. These differences reveal how (Z/H)GCRS can result from just two self-consistent processes: ubiquitous mass mixing (Z/H)SS/(Z/H)CCSN {\textasciitilde}4 of shocked, swept-up interstellar medium with high metallicity, core collapse supernova ejecta forming a base; and selective grain injection of refractory elements first condensed FGC as fast grains in freely expanding ejecta, then Coulomb-sputtered FCS by H and He as suprathermal ions into supernova shocks, where DSA carries them to cosmic-ray energies. This bulk mixing selectively increases source mix abundances (Z/H)SM /(Z/H)SS by {\textasciitilde}2-10; and injection by grain condensation fractions FGC, from meteoritic chondrules, further enhances by {\textasciitilde}6, while elemental-charge Z{\textasciicircum}2/3-Coulomb grain sputtering and scattering yields FCS give added enrichment of {\textasciitilde}4-20. Applying these basic processes of mixing and injection to solar system (chondrule) abundances (Z/H)SS produces grain-injected, source-mix (Z/H)SMGI that match major cosmic-ray abundances (Z/H)GCRS to 1+-35\% with no free parameters. Independently confirming the power of grain injection, (Z/H)GCRS shows no detectable contribution of Fe from SN Ia, which produce {\textasciitilde}1/2 Fe in ISM, which is quite consistent with no dust in SN Ia remnants, unlike CCSN.},

	abstract = {Seven-year-long seeing-free observations of solar magnetic fields with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) were used to study the sources of the solar mean magnetic field, SMMF, defined as the net line-of-sight magnetic flux divided over the solar disk area. To evaluate the contribution of different regions to the SMMF, we separated all the pixels of each SDO/HMI magnetogram into three subsets: weak (𝐵WBWB{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{W\}\}), intermediate (𝐵IBIB{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{I\}\}), and strong (𝐵SBSB{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{S\}\}) fields. The 𝐵WBWB{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{W\}\} component represents areas with magnetic flux densities below the chosen threshold; the 𝐵IBIB{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{I\}\} component is mainly represented by network fields, remains of decayed active regions (ARs), and ephemeral regions. The 𝐵SBSB{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{S\}\} component consists of magnetic elements in ARs. To derive the contribution of a subset to the total SMMF, the linear regression coefficients between the corresponding component and the SMMF were calculated. We found that i) when the threshold level of 30 Mx cm−2 is applied, the 𝐵IBIB{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{I\}\} and 𝐵SBSB{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{S\}\} components together contribute from 65\% to 95\% of the SMMF, while the fraction of the occupied area varies in a range of 2 – 6\% of the disk area; ii) as the threshold magnitude is lowered to 6 Mx cm−2, the contribution from 𝐵I+𝐵SBI+BSB{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{I\}\}+B{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{S\}\} grows to 98\%, and the fraction of the occupied area reaches a value of about 40\% of the solar disk. In summary, we found that regardless of the threshold level, only a small part of the solar disk area contributes to the SMMF. This means that the photospheric magnetic structure is an intermittent inherently porous medium, resembling a percolation cluster. These findings suggest that the long-standing concept that continuous vast unipolar areas on the solar surface are the source of the SMMF may need to be reconsidered.},

This investigation indicates that at the equator, the rotation rate for the last three days (of the lifetime) is about 1.3\% slower than that over the whole lifetime and about 0.5\% slower than during the first three days, but this is reversed at high and low latitudes, and the difference is much larger in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere.

	abstract = {We analyze the precursor of a Forbush Decrease (FD) observed with the Global Muon Detector Network on December 14, 2006. An intense geomagnetic storm is also recorded during this FD with the peak Kp index of 8+. By using the "two-dimensional map" of the cosmic ray intensity produced after removing the contribution from the diurnal anisotropy, we succeed in extracting clear signatures of the precursor. A striking feature of this event is that a weak loss-cone signature is first recorded more than a day prior to the Storm Sudden Commencement (SSC) onset. This suggests that the loss-cone precursor appeared only 7 hours after the Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) eruption from the Sun, when the Interplanetary (IP) shock driven by the Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME) located at 0.4 AU from the Sun. We find the precursor being successively observed with multiple detectors in the network according to the Earth's spin and confirmed that the precursor continuously exists in space. The long lead time (15.6 hours) of this precursor which is almost twice the typical value indicates that the IMF was more quiet in this event than a typical power spectrum assumed for the IMF turbulence. The amplitude (-6.45 \%) of the loss-cone anisotropy at the SSC onset is more than twice the FD size, indicating that the maximum intensity depression behind the IP shock is much larger than the FD size recorded at the Earth in this event. We also find the excess intensity from the sunward IMF direction clearly observed during {\textasciitilde}10 hours preceding the SSC onset. It is shown that this excess intensity is consistent with the measurement of the particles accelerated by the head-on collisions with the approaching shock. This is the first detailed observation of the precursor due to the shock reflected particles with muon detectors.},

	abstract = {A method for investigating the differential rotation of the solar corona using the coronal magnetic field as a tracer is proposed. The magnetic field is calculated in the potential approximation from observational data at the photospheric level. The time interval from June 24, 1976, to December 31, 2004, is considered. The magnetic field has been calculated for all latitudes from the equator to ±75◦ with a 5◦ step at distances from the base of the corona 1.0 R⊙ to 2.45 R⊙ near the source surface. The coronal rotation periods at 14 distances from the solar center have been determined by the method of periodogram analysis. The coronal rotation is shown to become progressively less differential with increasing heliocentric distance; it does not become rigid even near the source surface. The change in the coronal rotation periods with time is considered. At the cycleminimumthe rotation has been found to bemost differential, especially at small distances from the solar center. The change in coronal rotation with time is consistent with the tilt of the solar magnetic equator. The results from the magnetic field are compared with those obtained from the brightness of the green coronal Fe XIV 530.3 nm line. The consistency between these results confirms the reliability of the proposed method for studying the coronal rotation. Studying the rotation of the coronal magnetic field gives hope for the possibility of using this method to diagnose the differential rotation in subphotospheric layers.},

In particular, the midrange periodicities ranging from 37.9 days to 297.3 days are related to the magnetic Rossby-type waves; 2) The 1.3-year and 1.7-year fluctuations in solar activity indicators are surface manifestations (from photosphere to corona) of magnetic flux changes generated deep inside the Sun; 3) At the timescale of the Schwabe cycle, {\textbackslash}textbf\{the complicated phase relationships\} in the three intervals (1947-1958, 1959-1988, and 1989-2016) agree with the produced periodicities of the magnetic Rossby-type waves. {\textbackslash}textbf\{\vphantom{\}}The findings indicate that the magnetic Rossby-type waves are the possible physical mechanism behind the midrange periodicities of solar activity indicators.

	abstract = {We study the solar-cycle variation of subsurface flows from the surface to a depth of 16 Mm. We have used ring-diagram analysis to analyze Dopplergrams obtained with the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) Dynamics Program, the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG), and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument. We combined the zonal and meridional flows from the three data sources and scaled the flows derived from MDI and GONG to match those from HMI observations. In this way, we derived their temporal variation in a consistent manner for Solar Cycles 23 and 24. We have corrected the measured flows for systematic effects that vary with disk positions. Using time-depth slices of the corrected subsurface flows, we derived the amplitudes and times of the extrema of the fast and slow zonal and meridional flows during Cycles 23 and 24 at every depth and latitude. We find an average difference between maximum and minimum amplitudes of 8.6±0.4 ms−18.6±0.4 ms−18.6 {\textbackslash}pm0.4{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mbox\{m\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mbox\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} for the zonal flows and 7.9±0.3 ms−17.9±0.3 ms−17.9 {\textbackslash}pm0.3{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mbox\{m\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mbox\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} for the meridional flows associated with Cycle 24 averaged over a depth range from 2 to 12 Mm.

For Cycle 24, the flow patterns are precursors of the magnetic activity. The timing difference between the occurrence of the flow pattern and the magnetic one increases almost linearly with increasing latitude. For example, the fast zonal and meridional flow appear 2.1±0.62.1±0.62.1 {\textbackslash}pm 0.6 years and 2.5±0.62.5±0.62.5{\textbackslash}pm 0.6 years, respectively, before the magnetic pattern at 30∘30∘30{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\} latitude in the northern hemisphere, while in the southern hemisphere, the differences are 3.2±1.23.2±1.23.2 {\textbackslash}pm 1.2 years and 2.6±0.62.6±0.62.6 {\textbackslash}pm 0.6 years. The flow patterns of Cycle 25 are present and have reached 30∘30∘30{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\} latitude. The amplitude differences of Cycle 25 are about 22\% smaller than those of Cycle 24, but are comparable to those of Cycle 23. Moreover, polynomial fits of meridional flows suggest that equatorward meridional flows (counter-cells) might exist at about 80∘80∘80{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\} latitude except during the declining phase of the solar cycle.},

	abstract = {In the past few years, cosmic-rays beyond the GZK cut-off (\$E {\textgreater} 5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{19\}\$ eV) have been detected by leading collaborations such as Pierre Auger Observatory. Such observations raise many questions as to how such energies can be reached and what source can possibly produce them. Although at lower energies, mechanisms such as Fermi acceleration in supernovae front shocks seem to be favored, top-down scenarios have been proposed to explain the existence of ultra-high energy cosmic-rays: the decay of super-massive long-lived particles produced in the early Universe may yield to a flux of ultra-high energy photons. Such photons might be presently generating so called super-preshowers, an extended cosmic-ray shower with a spatial distribution that can be as wide as the Earth diameter. The Cosmic Ray Extremely Distributed Observatory (CREDO) mission is to find such events by means of a network of detectors spread around the globe. CREDO's strategy is to connect existing detectors and create a worldwide network of cosmic-ray observatories. Moreover, citizen-science constitutes an important pillar of our approach. By helping our algorithms to recognize detection patterns and by using smartphones as individual cosmic-ray detectors, non-scientists can participate in scientific discoveries and help unravel some of the deepest mysteries in physics.},

This network includes the MEXART radio telescope (solar flare and radio burst), the Compact Astronomical Low-frequency, Low-cost Instrument for Spectroscopy in Transportable Observatories (CALLISTO) at MEXART station (solar radio burst), the Mexico City Cosmic Ray Observatory (cosmics ray fluxes), GPS receiver networks (ionospheric disturbances), and the Geomagnetic Observatory of Teoloyucan (geomagnetic field). The observations show that we detected significant space weather effects over the Mexican territory: geomagnetic and ionospheric disturbances (22 June, 2015), variations in cosmic rays fluxes, and also radio communications interferences (29 September, 2015). The effects of these perturbations were registered, for the first time, using space weather products by SCiESMEX: TEC maps, regional geomagnetic index K mex , radio spectrographs of low frequency, and cosmic rays fluxes. These results prove the importance of monitoring space weather phenomena in the region and the need to strengthening the instrumentation network.},

Compared to earlier versions of the model in addition to the long-lived open flux, now also a more rapidly decaying component of the open flux is considered. The model parameters are constrained by comparing its output with observations of the total surface magnetic flux and with a reconstruction of the open magnetic flux based on the geomagnetic indexes. A method to compute the Sun's total magnetic flux and the sunspot number during the Holocene, starting from the open flux obtained from cosmogenic isotopes records, is also presented.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}By considering separately a rapidly evolving and a slowly evolving component of the open flux the model reproduces the Sun's open flux, as reconstructed based on the aa-index, much better and a reasonable description of the radial component of interplanetary magnetic field data is obtained. The greatest improvement is in the reproduction of the cyclic variation of the open flux, including the amplitudes of individual cycles. Furthermore, we found that approximately 25\% of the modeled open flux values since the end of the Maunder minimum are lower than the averaged value over 2008, i.e. during the current low minimum. The same proportion is observed in reconstructions of the open flux during the Holocene based on cosmogenic isotopes, which suggests that the present solar minimum conditions are below average, but not exceptional in terms of the heliospheric magnetic flux.},

We present analytical descriptions of the expected proﬁles, and validate the predictions through use of artiﬁcial seismic time-series data, in which temporal variations of the oscillator frequencies are introduced. Our main ﬁnding is that for the Sun-like frequency shifts the distortion of the asymmetrical Lorentzian-like proﬁles is very small, but also just detectible. Our analysis indicates that by ﬁtting modes to the usual Lorentzian-like models – which do not allow for the distortion – rather than new models we derive, there is a bias in the mode height and linewidth parameters that is comparable in size to the observational uncertainties given by multi-year data sets. Bias in the frequency parameter gives much less cause for worry, being over an order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding frequency uncertainties. The distortion discussed in this paper may need to be considered when multiyear Sun-like asteroseismic data sets are analysed on stars showing strong activity cycles.},

While normal magnetic diffusivity predicts lifetimes of sunspots that are too large by at least two orders of magnitude, turbulent magnetic diffusivity accounts for both the functional form of the solar empirical spot-lifetime relation and for the observed sunspot lifetimes, provided that the relevant diffusion length is the supergranule size. Applying this relation to other stars, the value of turbulent diffusivity depends almost entirely on supergranule size, with very weak dependence on other variables such as magnetic field strength and density. Overall, the best observational data for other stars is consistent with the extension of the solar relation, provided that stellar supergranule sizes for some stars are significantly larger than they are on the Sun.},

	abstract = {The splitting of the frequencies of the global resonant acoustic modes of the Sun by large-scale flows and rotation permits study of the variation of angular velocity Ω with both radius and latitude within the turbulent convection zone and the deeper radiative interior. The nearly uninterrupted Doppler imaging observations, provided by the Solar Oscillations Investigation (SOI) using the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) spacecraft positioned at the L 1 Lagrangian point in continuous sunlight, yield oscillation power spectra with very high signal-to-noise ratios that allow frequency splittings to be determined with exceptional accuracy. This paper reports on joint helioseismic analyses of solar rotation in the convection zone and in the outer part of the radiative core. Inversions have been obtained for a medium- l mode set (involving modes of angular degree l extending to about 250) obtained from the first 144 day interval of SOI-MDI observations in 1996. Drawing inferences about the solar internal rotation from the splitting data is a subtle process. By applying more than one inversion technique to the data, we get some indication of what are the more robust and less robust features of our inversion solutions. Here we have used seven different inversion methods. To test the reliability and sensitivity of these methods, we have performed a set of controlled experiments utilizing artificial data. This gives us some confidence in the inferences we can draw from the real solar data. The inversions of SOI-MDI data have confirmed that the decrease of Ω with latitude seen at the surface extends with little radial variation through much of the convection zone, at the base of which is an adjustment layer, called the tachocline, leading to nearly uniform rotation deeper in the radiative interior. A prominent rotational shearing layer in which Ω increases just below the surface is discernible at low to mid latitudes. Using the new data, we have also been able to study the solar rotation closer to the poles than has been achieved in previous investigations. The data have revealed that the angular velocity is distinctly lower at high latitudes than the values previously extrapolated from measurements at lower latitudes based on surface Doppler observations and helioseismology. Furthermore, we have found some evidence near latitudes of 75° of a submerged polar jet which is rotating more rapidly than its immediate surroundings. Superposed on the relatively smooth latitudinal variation in Ω are alternating zonal bands of slightly faster and slower rotation, each extending some 10° to 15° in latitude. These relatively weak banded flows have been followed by inversion to a depth of about 5\% of the solar radius and appear to coincide with the evolving pattern of "torsional oscillations" reported from earlier surface Doppler studies.},

	url = {http://inspirehep.net/record/1424402/files/thesis.pdf},
	abstract = {Cosmic rays in the TeV to PeV energy range are believed to originate in our galaxy, possibly in local astrophysical accelerators such as supernova remnants. After escaping from their sources, cosmic rays propagate through the interstellar medium where they scatteroff turbulences in the Galactic magnetic field. This scattering process efficiently isotropizes the trajectories of cosmic rays before their arrival at Earth. However, it is predicted that a dipolar anisotropy with per-mille amplitude or lower should subsist in their arrival directions.
Such an anisotropy was observed for the first time at TeV energies by detectors in the northern hemisphere, and its study revealed the presence of both large angular scale structure (usually interpreted as the aforementioned dipole produced by cosmic-ray diffusion) and anisotropy with smaller angular size and amplitude.
Large-scale anisotropy at TeV energies in the southern hemisphere was detected for the first time using data from IceCube, a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector that is sensitive to muons created in the interaction of cosmic rays with the atmosphere. The orientation of the large-scale component is consistent with that observed in the north.
In this work, results from three analyses are presented which expand the study of cosmic-ray anisotropy in the southern sky and are aimed at characterizing its evolution as a function of angular scale, energy, and time. Data from three cosmic-ray detectors are used: IceCube, its predecessor experiment AMANDA, and the IceTop air-shower array, all located at the South Pole.
Significant anisotropy is observed over a wide range of angular scales (from large-scale to few-degrees structure), and energies (from 20 TeV to 2 PeV.) The relative amplitude of the large-scale anisotropy is \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{−3\}\$ , while smaller structures have amplitudes of the order of \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{−4\}\$. No significant variation is observed in the TeV anisotropy pattern over the 12-year period considered in this work.
These studies provide a complete picture of the cosmic-ray anisotropy in the southern sky at TeV and PeV energies. The coordinated study of the three main cosmic-ray observables (spectrum, composition, and anisotropy) will provide information about the origin of these particles and the environment through which they propagate.},

This paper compares differential rotation measurements from four techniques: Doppler shift, Doppler feature tracking, magnetic feature tracking, and p-mode splittings. The different rotation rates measured by the first three techniques are interpreted as rotation rates of solar phenomena which depend on the properties and depth of that which is measured. This interpretation is supported by comparison with rotation measurements obtained from p-mode splittings except for Doppler features. The rotation rate of the plasma corresponds to the surface rate obtained by inversions; the rates of magnetic features correspond to the rotation rate at various depths within the convection zone. Supergranulation rotates at a rate greater than the maximum rotation rate within the convection zone, suggesting that supergranules are not simple convection cells anchored at a particular depth.},

After introducing some basic helioseismic concepts, it covers, in turn, the rotation of the core and radiative interior, the “tachocline” shear layer at the base of the convection zone, the differential rotation in the convection zone, the near-surface shear, the pattern of migrating zonal flows known as the torsional oscillation, and the possible temporal variations at the bottom of the convection zone. For each area, the article also briefly explores the relationship between observations and models.},

	abstract = {The latitudinal migration of sunspots toward the equator, which implies there is propagation of the toroidal magnetic flux wave at the base of the solar convection zone, is one of the crucial observational bases for the solar dynamo to generate a magnetic field by shearing of the pre-existing poloidal magnetic field through differential rotation. The Extended time series of Solar Activity Indices (ESAI) elongated the Greenwich observation record of sunspots by several decades in the past. In this study, ESAI’s yearly mean latitude of sunspots in the northern and southern hemispheres during the years 1854 to 1985 is utilized to statistically test whether hemispherical latitudinal migration of sunspots in a solar cycle is linear or nonlinear. It is found that a quadratic function is statistically significantly better at describing hemispherical latitudinal migration of sunspots in a solar cycle than a linear function. In addition, the latitude migration velocity of sunspots in a solar cycle decreases as the cycle progresses, providing a particular constraint for solar dynamo models. Indeed, the butterfly wing pattern with a faster latitudinal migration rate should present stronger solar activity with a shorter cycle period, and it is located at higher latitudinal position, giving evidence to support the Babcock-Leighton dynamo mechanism.},

	abstract = {Helioseismology has transformed our knowledge of the Sun's rotation. Earlier studies revealed the Sun's surface rotation, but now a detailed observational picture has been built up of the internal rotation of our nearest star. Unlike the predictions of stellar-evolution models, the radiative interior is found to rotate roughly uniformly. The rotation within the convection zone is also very different from prior expectations, which had been that the rotation rate would depend primarily on the distance from the rotation axis. Layers of rotational shear have been discovered at the base of the convection zone and in the subphotospheric layers. Studies of the time variation of rotation have uncovered zonal-flow bands, extending through a substantial fraction of the convection zone, which migrate over the course of the solar cycle, and there are hints of other temporal variations and of a jet-like structure. At the same time, building on earlier work with mean-field models, researchers have made great progress in supercomputer simulations of the intricate interplay between turbulent convection and rotation in the Sun's interior. Such studies are beginning to transform our understanding of how rotation organizes itself in a stellar interior.},

We study the time lag between GCRs intensity and various solar, geomagnetic and interplanetary parameters separately during the solar cycles under investigation. Further, we have investigated the presence and temporal evolution of mid term quasi-periodicities of GCRs time series during the above mentioned phases utilizing both Morlet wavelet transform and Scargle periodogram technique. Power spectral analysis indicates the presence of several mid term quasi-periodicities including Rieger type and Quasi-biennial oscillations.

This data set was used for a detailed analysis of the cosmic-ray arrival direction anisotropy in the TeV to PeV energy range. The observed global anisotropy features large regions of relative excess and deficit, with amplitudes on the order of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ up to about 100 TeV. A decomposition of the arrival direction distribution into spherical harmonics shows that most of the power is contained in the low-multipole (\${\textbackslash}ell{\textbackslash}leq 4\$) moments. However, higher multipole components are found to be statistically significant down to an angular scale of less than \$10{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$, approaching the angular resolution of the detector. Above 100 TeV, a change in the morphology of the arrival direction distribution is observed, and the anisotropy is characterized by a wide relative deficit whose amplitude increases with primary energy up to at least 5{\textbackslash},PeV, the highest energies currently accessible to IceCube. No time dependence of the large- and small-scale structures is observed in the six-year period covered by this analysis. The high-statistics data set reveals more details on the properties of the anisotropy and is potentially able to shed light on the various physical processes that are responsible for the complex angular structure and energy evolution.},

	abstract = {We study the shape of sunspot cycles using the Wolf sunspot numbers and group sunspot numbers of solar cycles 1-23. We determine the most typical "model" cycles and the most asymmetric cycles, and test the validity of the two Waldmeier rules: the anti-correlation between cycle height and the length of its ascending phase (rule 1), and between cycle height and the length of the preceding cycle (rule 2). We applied the principal component analysis to sunspot cycles and studied the first two components, which describe the average cycle shape and cycle asymmetry, respectively. We also calculated their autocorrelation in order to study their recurrence properties. The best model cycles for Wolf numbers are SC12, SC14, and SC16, the successive even cycles from a long period of rather low overall solar activity. We find that the model cycles in eight different analyses using both sunspot series are almost exclusively even cycles. Correspondingly, the most asymmetric cycles are odd cycles. We find that both Waldmeier rules are valid for the whole Wolf number series of 23 cycles. Waldmeier rule 2 is also valid for group number series although its significance is weaker. Waldmeier rule 1 is not significant for the original group number series, but becomes significant for the proxy series. For separate centuries, Waldmeier rules are not always valid for Wolf numbers and very rarely for group numbers. Our results also offer a new interpretation for the Gnevyshev gap. In addition to being a local depression of solar activity, the Gnevyshev gap is a separatrix that divides cycles into two parts whose relative intensities determine the cycle asymmetry. The Gnevyshev gap is the zero value time of PC2, located approximately 33-42\% into the cycle after its start.},

	abstract = {Solar cycles are studied with the Version 2 monthly smoothed international sunspot number, the variations of which are found to be well represented by the modified logistic differential equation with four parameters: maximum cumulative sunspot number or total sunspot number \$x\_m\$, initial cumulative sunspot number \$x\_0\$, maximum emergence rate \$r\_0\$, and asymmetry \${\textbackslash}alpha\$. A two-parameter function is obtained by taking \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and \$r\_0\$ as fixed value. In addition, it is found that \$x\_m\$ and \$x\_0\$ can be well determined at the start of a cycle. Therefore, a prediction model of sunspot number is established based on the two-parameter function. The prediction for cycles \$4-23\$ shows that the solar maximum can be predicted with average relative error being 8.8{\textbackslash}\% and maximum relative error being 22{\textbackslash}\% in cycle 15 at the start of solar cycles if solar minima are already known. The quasi-online method for determining solar minimum moment shows that we can obtain the solar minimum 14 months after the start of a cycle. Besides, our model can predict the cycle length with the average relative error being 9.5{\textbackslash}\% and maximum relative error being 22{\textbackslash}\% in cycle 4. Furthermore, we predict the sunspot number variations of cycle 24 with the relative errors of the solar maximum and ascent time being 1.4{\textbackslash}\% and 12{\textbackslash}\%, respectively, and the predicted cycle length is 11.0 (95{\textbackslash}\% confidence interval is 8.3\$-\$12.9) years. The comparison to the observation of cycle 24 shows that our prediction model has good effectiveness.},

	abstract = {A new model called “PHITS-based Analytical Radiation Model in the Atmosphere (PARMA) version 4.0” was developed to facilitate instantaneous estimation of not only omnidirectional but also angular differential energy spectra of cosmic ray fluxes anywhere in Earth’s atmosphere at nearly any given time. It consists of its previous version, PARMA3.0, for calculating the omnidirectional fluxes and several mathematical functions proposed in this study for expressing their zenith-angle dependences. The numerical values of the parameters used in these functions were fitted to reproduce the results of the extensive air shower simulation performed by Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System (PHITS). The angular distributions of ground-level muons at large zenith angles were specially determined by introducing an optional function developed on the basis of experimental data. The accuracy of PARMA4.0 was closely verified using multiple sets of experimental data obtained under various global conditions. This extension enlarges the model’s applicability to more areas of research, including design of cosmic-ray detectors, muon radiography, soil moisture monitoring, and cosmic-ray shielding calculation. PARMA4.0 is available freely and is easy to use, as implemented in the open-access EXcel-based Program for Calculating Atmospheric Cosmic-ray Spectrum (EXPACS).},

	abstract = {We analyze the short cosmic ray intensity increase ("cosmic ray burst": CRB) on June 22, 2015 utilizing a global network of muon detectors and derive the global anisotropy of cosmic ray intensity and the density (i.e. the omnidirectional intensity) with 10-minute time resolution. We find that the CRB was caused by a local density maximum and an enhanced anisotropy of cosmic rays both of which appeared in association with Earth's crossing of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). This enhanced anisotropy was normal to the HCS and consistent with a diamagnetic drift arising from the spatial gradient of cosmic ray density, which indicates that cosmic rays were drifting along the HCS from the north of Earth. We also find a significant anisotropy along the HCS, lasting a few hours after the HCS crossing, indicating that cosmic rays penetrated into the inner heliosphere along the HCS. Based on the latest geomagnetic field model, we quantitatively evaluate the reduction of the geomagnetic cut-off rigidity and the variation of the asymptotic viewing direction of cosmic rays due to a major geomagnetic storm which occurred during the CRB and conclude that the CRB is not caused by the geomagnetic storm, but by a rapid change in the cosmic ray anisotropy and density outside the magnetosphere.},

We use \$Kepler\$ short-cadence data, of which each star has at least 12 months, to create frequency power spectra optimized for asteroseismology. For each star we identify its modes of oscillation and extract parameters such as frequency, amplitude, and line width using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo `peak-bagging' approach. We report the extracted mode parameters for all 66 stars, as well as derived quantities such as frequency difference ratios, the large and small separations \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textbackslash}nu\$ and \${\textbackslash}delta{\textbackslash}nu\_\{02\}\$; the behavior of line widths with frequency and line widths at \${\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$ with \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$, for which we derive parametrizations; and behavior of mode visibilities. These average properties can be applied in future peak-bagging exercises to better constrain the parameters of the stellar oscillation spectra. The frequencies and frequency ratios can tightly constrain the fundamental parameters of these solar-type stars, and mode line widths and amplitudes can test models of mode damping and excitation.},

	abstract = {Wide-field high precision photometric surveys such as Kepler have produced reams of data suitable for investigating stellar magnetic activity of cooler stars. Starspot activity produces quasi-sinusoidal light curves whose phase and amplitude vary as active regions grow and decay over time. Here we investigate, firstly, whether there is a correlation between the size of starspots - assumed to be related to the amplitude of the sinusoid - and their decay timescale and, secondly, whether any such correlation depends on the stellar effective temperature. To determine this, we computed the autocorrelation functions of the light curves of samples of stars from Kepler and fitted them with apodised periodic functions. The light curve amplitudes, representing spot size were measured from the root-mean-squared scatter of the normalised light curves. We used a Monte Carlo Markov Chain to measure the periods and decay timescales of the light curves. The results show a correlation between the decay time of starspots and their inferred size. The decay time also depends strongly on the temperature of the star. Cooler stars have spots that last much longer, in particular for stars with longer rotational periods. This is consistent with current theories of diffusive mechanisms causing starspot decay. We also find that the Sun is not unusually quiet for its spectral type - stars with solar-type rotation periods and temperatures tend to have (comparatively) smaller starspots than stars with mid-G or later spectral types.},

	abstract = {The time-dependent modulation of galactic cosmic rays in the heliosphere is studied by computing intensities using a time-dependent modulation model. By introducing recent theoretical advances in the transport coefficients in the model, computed intensities are compared with Voyager 1, International Monitoring Platform (IMP) 8, and Ulysses proton observations in search of compatibility. The effect of different modulation parameters on computed intensities is also illustrated. It is shown that this approach produces, on a global scale, realistic cosmic-ray proton intensities along the Voyager 1 spacecraft trajectory and at Earth upto {\textasciitilde}2004, whereafter the computed intensities recovers much slower towards solar minimum than observed in the inner heliosphere. A modified time dependence in the diffusion coefficients is proposed to improve compatibility with the observations at Earth after {\textasciitilde}2004. This modified time dependence led to an improved compatibility between computed intensities and the observations along the Voyager 1 trajectory and at Earth even after {\textasciitilde}2004. An interesting result is that the cosmic-ray modulation during the present polarity cycle is not determined only by changes in the drift coefficient and tilt angle of the wavy current sheet, but is also largely dependent on changes in the diffusion coefficients.},

	abstract = {We have studied short-lived (21 minute average duration), highly anisotropic pulses of cosmic rays that constitute the first phase of 10 large ground-level enhancements (GLEs), and which extend to rigidities in the range 5-20 GV. We provide a set of constraints that must be met by any putative acceleration mechanism for this type of solar-energetic-particle (SEP) event. The pulses usually have very short rise-times (three to five minutes) at all rigidities, and exhibit the remarkable feature that the intensity drops precipitously by 50\% to 70\% from the maximum within another three to five minutes. Both the rising and falling phases exhibit velocity dispersion, which indicates that there are particles with rigidities in the range 1 {\textless} P (GV) {\textless} 3 in the beam, and the evidence is that there is little scattering en route from the Sun. We name these events the high-energy impulsive ground-level enhancement (HEI GLE). We argue that the time-dependence observed at Earth at 5 GV is a close approximation to that of the SEP pulse injected into the open heliospheric magnetic field in the vicinity of the Sun. We conclude that the temporal characteristics of the HEI GLE impose nine constraints on any putative acceleration process. Two of the HEI GLEs are preceded by short-lived, fast-rising neutron and {\textgreater}90 MeV gamma-ray bursts, indicating that freshly accelerated SEPs had impinged on higher-density matter in the chromosphere prior to the departure of the SEP pulse for Earth. This study was based on an updated archive of the 71 GLEs in the historic record, which is now available for public use.},

	abstract = {By means of an analysis of data from eight neutron monitor (NM) stations with different geomagnetic cutoff rigidities, we found an unusual latitudinal effect observed in the cosmic-ray (CR) modulation during the last solar cycles. Since the beginning of the ground-based cosmic-ray monitoring, it is known that the solar-cycle modulation is more evident in data from high latitude than from the medium and low latitudes, showing an expected geomagnetic cutoff rigidity effect. However, a more detailed look shows a new latitudinal effect in cycle 24: while the magnitude of the solar modulation in the low-latitude data remains the same for the last three solar minima, the last solar minimum caused a more intense peak in the polar NM data than in the previous cycles. After correcting the data for the geomagnetic changes of the period, we found an anomalous solar modulation in the last cycle. This suggests a weaker heliospheric modulation at low-energy particles (responsible for the NM counting in polar sites) now than in the previous cycles, while there is no significant difference of the modulation for the more energetic part of the CR spectrum. Our result can be associated with changes of the solar wind turbulence, which would corroborate some recent studies about the last solar minimum phase, and indicates that this new solar modulation feature is still present in the current solar maximum stage.},

	abstract = {Mounted on the sides of two widely separated spacecraft, the two Heliospheric Imager (HI) instruments onboard NASA’s STEREO mission view, for the first time, the space between the Sun and Earth. These instruments are wide-angle visible-light imagers that incorporate sufficient baffling to eliminate scattered light to the extent that the passage of solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) through the heliosphere can be detected. Each HI instrument comprises two cameras, HI-1 and HI-2, which have 20° and 70° fields of view and are off-pointed from the Sun direction by 14.0° and 53.7°, respectively, with their optical axes aligned in the ecliptic plane. This arrangement provides coverage over solar elongation angles from 4.0° to 88.7° at the viewpoints of the two spacecraft, thereby allowing the observation of Earth-directed CMEs along the Sun – Earth line to the vicinity of the Earth and beyond. Given the two separated platforms, this also presents the first opportunity to view the structure and evolution of CMEs in three dimensions. The STEREO spacecraft were launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Base in late October 2006, and the HI instruments have been performing scientific observations since early 2007. The design, development, manufacture, and calibration of these unique instruments are reviewed in this paper. Mission operations, including the initial commissioning phase and the science operations phase, are described. Data processing and analysis procedures are briefly discussed, and ground-test results and in-orbit observations are used to demonstrate that the performance of the instruments meets the original scientific requirements.},

	abstract = {We employ remote observations of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and the associated solar flares to forecast the CME-related Forbush decreases, i.e. short-term depressions in the galactic cosmic-ray flux. The relation between the Forbush effect at Earth and remote observations of CMEs and associated solar flares is studied via a statistical analysis. Relations between Forbush decrease magnitude and several CME/flare parameters were found: the initial CME speed, apparent width, source position, associated solar-flare class, and the effect of successive-CME occurrence. Based on the statistical analysis, remote solar observations are employed to forecast a Forbush-decrease. For this purpose, an empirical probabilistic model is constructed that uses selected remote solar observations of the CME and associated solar flare as input and gives the expected Forbush-decrease magnitude range as output. The forecast method is evaluated using several verification measures, indicating that as the forecast tends to be more specific, it is less reliable, which is its main drawback. However, the advantages of the method are that it provides an early prediction and that the input does not necessarily depend on using a spacecraft.},

	abstract = {Aims: A Forbush decrease (FD) is a transient decrease followed by 
a gradual recovery in the observed galactic cosmic ray intensity. We
seek to understand the relationship between the FDs and near-Earth
interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) enhancements associated with solar
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Methods: We used muon data at
cutoff rigidities ranging from 14 to 24 GV from the GRAPES-3 tracking
muon telescope to identify FD events. We selected those FD events that
have a reasonably clean profile, and magnitude {\textgreater}0.25\%. We used IMF
data from ACE/WIND spacecrafts. We looked for correlations between the
FD profile and that of the one-hour averaged IMF. We wanted to find out
whether if the diffusion of high-energy protons into the large scale
magnetic field is the cause of the lag observed between the FD and the
IMF. Results: The enhancement of the IMF associated with FDs
occurs mainly in the shock-sheath region, and the turbulence level in
the magnetic field is also enhanced in this region. The observed FD
profiles look remarkably similar to the IMF enhancement profiles. The
FDs typically lag behind the IMF enhancement by a few hours. The lag
corresponds to the time taken by high-energy protons to diffuse into the
magnetic field enhancement via cross-field diffusion. 
Conclusions: Our findings show that high-rigidity FDs associated with
CMEs are caused primarily by the cumulative diffusion of protons across
the magnetic field enhancement in the turbulent sheath region between
the shock and the CME.

Recent studies showed that galactic cosmic rays play a signi cant role in the formation of low cloud coverage and its consequent impact on the global temperature variation of the earth. A long-term measurement of the cosmic ray flux distribution at the surface of the earth has been established at Georgia State University. The current e ort is focused on understanding the correlations between the cosmic ray particle  flux distribution and the atmospheric and space weather measurements. In order to understand the  observed atmospheric e ects on cosmic ray flux, numerical simulations of cosmic muon and neutron  ux variations at the surface of the earth have been carried out with varying air densities in the troposphere and stratosphere based on the Geant4 package. The simulation results show a remarkably good agreement with observations. The simulation results also show that the stratosphere air density variation dominates the effects on the muon  flux changes while the density variation in the troposphere mainly influences the neutron count variation. This suggests that the long-term variation of muon flux could possibly direct us to a new path to understand the global climate warming trend.},

Earlier results of theoretical and fragmentary statistical studies are in disagreement whether the recovery time does or does not depend on the energy of cosmic rays. A thorough empirical study of the recovery phase of strong isolated Forbush decreases is presented here, based on the ground based data from the World Neutron Monitor Network since 1964 and three ground based muon telescopes since 1973. In total 39 strong Forbush decreases, suitable for the analysis, have been identified for the period 1964–2006, 24 of them depicting a clear energy dependence of the recovery time and 15 consistent with no energy dependence. All analyzed Forbush decreases with magnitudes exceeding 10\% demonstrate an energy dependence of the recovery time, while smaller events can be of either type. No apparent relation between the occurrence of energy dependent/independent recovery and the IMF polarity has been found. This result provides an observational constraint for more detailed modeling of the propagation of interplanetary transients and their dynamic effects on cosmic ray transport.},

We study past events to optimize appropriate intensity threshold values and a baseline to determine the intensity increase. The highest-level alarm, which we term an “alert,” is generated when a 4\% increase is recorded at three stations in 3 min averaged data. At this level, the false alarm rate obtained by backtesting over the past 4.4 years is zero. Ten GLEs occurred in this period, and our system produced GLE alarms for nine events. Alarm times for these nine events are compared with satellite proton data. The GLE alert precedes the earliest alert from GOES (100 MeV or 10 MeV protons) by ∼10–30 min. Real-time GLE data may be viewed at http://neutronm.bartol.udel.edu/spaceweather. An automated e-mail alert system is under development.},

These effects need to be considered in the interpretation of STEREO-HI data for astronomy. In this paper we present an analysis of these effects and how to compensate for them when using STEREO-HI data for astronomical studies. We
determine how saturation of the HI CCD detectors affects the apparent count rates of stars after the on-board summing of pixels and exposures. Single-exposure calibration images are analyzed and compared with binned and summed science images to determine the influence of saturation on the science images. We also analyze how the on-board cosmic-ray
scrubbing algorithm affects stellar images. We determine how this interacts with the variations of instrument pointing to affect
measurements of stars. We find that saturation is a significant effect only for the brightest stars, and that its onset is gradual. We also find that degraded pointing stability, whether of the entire spacecraft or of the imagers, leads to reduced stellar count rates and also increased variation thereof through interaction with the on-board cosmic-ray scrubbing algorithm. We suggest ways in which these effects can be mitigated for astronomical studies and also suggest how the situation can be improved for future imagers.},

The temporal decay of the absorption is consistent with absorption by a CME undergoing self-similar evolution with uniform expansion velocity. We investigate the kinematic and energetic properties of the CME using the ice-cream cone model for its three-dimensional structure in combination with the observed profile of the hydrogen column density decline with time. Different physically justified length scales were used that allowed us to estimate lower and upper limits of the possible CME characteristics. Further consideration of the maximum available magnetic energy in starspots leads us to quantify its mass as likely lying in the range \$2{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{21\}\$-\$2{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{22\}\$ g and kinetic energy in the range \$7{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{35\}\$-\$3{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{38\}\$ erg.

This formation scenario leads to a cometary make-up that is simultaneously compatible with the global porosity, homogeneity, tensile strength, thermal inertia, vertical temperature profiles, sizes and porosities of emitted dust, and the steep increase in water-vapour production rate with decreasing heliocentric distance, measured by the instruments on-board the Rosetta spacecraft and the Philae lander.

We begin with a general survey of the available data, including a description of the energy spectrum, the nuclear composition, and the distribution of arrival directions. At this point we also give a synopsis of experimental techniques. After that, we introduce the fundamentals of cosmic ray acceleration and energy loss during propagation, with a view of discussing the conjectured nearby sources. Next, we survey the state of the art regarding the high- and ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrinos which should be produced in association with the observed cosmic rays. These neutrinos can constitute key messengers identifying currently unknown cosmic accelerators, possibly in the distant universe, because their propagation is not influenced by background photon or magnetic fields. Subsequently, we summarize the phenomenology of cosmic ray air showers. We describe the hadronic interaction models used to extrapolate results from collider data to ultra-high energies and the main electromagnetic processes that govern the longitudinal shower evolution. Armed with these two principal shower ingredients and motivation from the underlying physics, we describe the different methods proposed to distinguish the primary particle species. In the end, we explore how ultra-high-energy cosmic rays can be used as probes of beyond standard model physics models.},

For the simulation of low energy primary particles the original CORSIKA has been extended by a parametrization of the solar modulation and a microscopic calculation of the directional dependence of the geomagnetic cut-off functions. An accurate description for the geography of the Earth has been included by a digital elevation model, tables for the local magnetic field in the atmosphere, and various atmospheric models for different geographic latitudes and annual seasons. CORSIKA is used to calculate atmospheric muon fluxes for different locations and the neutrino fluxes for Kamioka. The results of CORSIKA for the muon fluxes are verified by an extensive comparison with recent measurements. The obtained neutrino fluxes are compared with other calculations and the influence of the hadronic interaction model, the geomagnetic cut-off and the local magnetic field on the neutrino fluxes is investigated.},

	abstract = {Recent cosmic-ray measurements have found an anomaly in the cosmic-ray energy spectrum at GeV-TeV energies. Although the origin of the anomaly is not clearly understood, suggested explanations include effect of cosmic-ray source spectrum, propagation effects, and the effect of nearby sources. In this paper, we propose that the spectral anomaly might be an effect of re-acceleration of cosmic rays by weak shocks in the Galaxy. After acceleration by strong supernova remnant shock waves, cosmic rays undergo diffusive propagation through the Galaxy. During the propagation, cosmic rays may again encounter expanding supernova remnant shock waves, and get re-accelerated. As the probability of encountering old supernova remnants is expected to be larger than the younger ones due to their bigger sizes, re-acceleration is expected to be mainly due to weaker shocks. Since weaker shocks generate a softer particle spectrum, the resulting re-accelerated component will have a spectrum steeper than the initial cosmic-ray source spectrum produced by strong shocks. For a reasonable set of model parameters, it is shown that such re-accelerated component can dominate the GeV energy region while the non-reaccelerated component dominates at higher energies, explaining the observed GeV-TeV spectral anomaly.},

	abstract = {We have carried out a detailed study to understand the observed energy spectrum and composition of cosmic rays with energies up to {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}18 eV. Our study shows that a single Galactic component with subsequent energy cut-offs in the individual spectra of different elements, optimised to explain the observed spectra below {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}14 eV and the knee in the all-particle spectrum, cannot explain the observed all-particle spectrum above {\textasciitilde}2x10{\textasciicircum}16 eV. We discuss two approaches for a second component of Galactic cosmic rays -- re-acceleration at a Galactic wind termination shock, and supernova explosions of Wolf-Rayet stars, and show that the latter scenario can explain almost all observed features in the all-particle spectrum and the composition up to {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}18 eV, when combined with a canonical extra-galactic spectrum expected from strong radio galaxies or a source population with similar cosmological evolution. In this two-component Galactic model, the knee at {\textasciitilde} 3x10{\textasciicircum}15 eV and the second knee at {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}17 eV in the all-particle spectrum are due to the cut-offs in the first and second components, respectively. We also discuss several variations of the extra-galactic component, from a minimal contribution to scenarios with a significant component below the ankle (at {\textasciitilde}4x10{\textasciicircum}18 eV), and find that extra-galactic contributions in excess of regular source evolution are neither indicated nor in conflict with the existing data. Our main result is that the second Galactic component predicts a composition of Galactic cosmic rays at and above the second knee that largely consists of helium or a mixture of helium and CNO nuclei, with a weak or essentially vanishing iron fraction, in contrast to most common assumptions. This prediction is in agreement with new measurements from LOFAR and the Pierre Auger Observatory which indicate a strong light component and a rather low iron fraction between {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}17 and 10{\textasciicircum}18 eV.},

It is shown that Ropt is approximately independent of characteristics of primary particle and it is only dependent to array configuration. Dependency of Ropt on layout and detector spacing for 20 Alborz-I array detectors, are studied. It is shown that the Alborz-I array layout and its detector spacing result into the best (minimum uncertainty) Ropt for its number of detectors. In this work Ropt for Alborz-I array is obtained about 9 m. In addition, it is shown that, by finding dependency of primary energy to density in optimum distance, energy of primary particle can be estimated well.

	abstract = {The last solar minimum was, by recent standards, unusually deep and long. We are now close to the maximum of the subsequent solar cycle, which is relatively weak. In this article we make comparisons between different global (unresolved) measures of the Sun's magnetic activity, to investigate how they are responding to this weak-activity epoch. We focus on helioseismic data, which are sensitive to conditions, including the characteristics of the magnetic field, in the solar interior. Also considered are measures of the magnetic field in the photosphere (sunspot number and sunspot area), the chromosphere and corona (10.7cm radio flux and 530.3nm green coronal index), and two measures of the Sun's magnetic activity closer to Earth (the interplanetary magnetic field and the galactic cosmic-ray intensity). Scaled versions of the activity proxies diverge from the helioseismic data around 2000, indicating a change in relationship between the proxies. The degree of divergence varies from proxy to proxy with sunspot area and 10.7cm flux showing only small deviations, while sunspot number, coronal index, and the two interplanetary proxies show much larger departures. In Cycle 24 the deviations in the solar proxies and the helioseismic data decrease, raising the possibility that the deviations observed in Cycle 23 are just symptomatic of a 22-year Hale cycle. However, the deviations in the helioseismic data and the interplanetary proxies increase in Cycle 24. Interestingly the divergence in the solar proxies and the helioseismic data are not reflected in the shorter-term variations (often referred to as quasi-biennial oscillations) observed on top of the dominant 11-year solar cycle. However, despite being highly correlated in Cycle 22, the short-term variations in the interplanetary proxies show very little correlation with the helioseismic data during Cycles 23 and 24.},

We will discuss the basic physics of the cosmic-ray transport equation, first written down by Parker (1965). This equation is remarkably robust and is widely used to study cosmic-ray transport in the solar system and the interstellar medium. The chapter starts with a general background on cosmic rays in the solar system. The transport equation itself is not formally derived, but the basic physical processes that lead to the various terms in this equation are discussed in detail. We will also address what assumptions are made about this equation and under what conditions it is applicable. At the end of this chapter, we provide a few applications related to specific heliophysics phenomena, such as the propagation of solar-energetic particles in the inner heliosphere, the modulation of galactic cosmic rays, and the drift motions of cosmic rays in the solar system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}span class='bold'{\textgreater}Cosmic rays in the solar system{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}A fundamental and outstanding problem in astrophysics concerns the origin of high-energy charged particles in space. This problem has been known since the early 1900s when Victor Hess performed his famous electroscope experiments on balloon flights to demonstrate that the excess atmospheric radiation increased with increasing distance from the Earth's surface. This led to the discovery of cosmic rays. In the 1920s Chapman and Ferraro considered the effect on Earth of localized and intermittent streams of corpuscular radiation. It was later determined that the solar corpuscular radiation had two components: one that was steady, now known as the solar wind, and the other intermittent, that we now know to be solar energetic particles.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

From ionization chambers, the decrease of intensity from its maxima (near sunspot minima) is shown to lag a year or more behind the increase of solar activity following sunspot minima.

	abstract = {An interpretation of Akeno giant air shower array (AGASA) data by comparing the experimental results with the simulated ones by cosmic ray simulation for KASCADE (CORSIKA) has been made. General features of the electromagnetic component and low energy muons observed by AGASA can be well reproduced by CORSIKA. The form of the lateral distribution of charged particles agrees well with the experimental one between a few hundred metres and 2000 m from the core, irrespective of the hadronic interaction model studied and the primary composition (proton or iron). It does not depend on the primary energy between 1017.5 and 1020 eV as the experiment shows. If we evaluate the particle density measured by scintillators of 5 cm thickness at 600 m from the core S0(600), suffix 0 denotes the vertically incident shower) by taking into account the similar conditions as in the experiment, the conversion relation from S0(600) to the primary energy is expressed as E(eV)=2.15×1017S0(600)1.015 within 10\% uncertainty among the models and composition used, which suggests the present AGASA conversion factor is the lower limit. Although the form of the muon lateral distribution fits well to the experiment within 1000 m from the core, the absolute values change with hadronic interaction model and primary composition. The slope of the ρμ(600) (muon density above 1 GeV at 600 m from the core) vs. S0(600) relation in experiment is flatter than that in simulation of any hadronic model and primary composition. As the experimental slope is constant from 1015 to 1019 eV, we need to study this relation in a wide primary energy range to infer the rate of change of chemical composition with energy.},

CORSIKA is used to calculate atmospheric muon fluxes for different locations and the neutrino fluxes for Kamioka.

	abstract = {The solar corona is a hot, dynamic, and highly magnetized plasma environment whose source of energy is not yet well understood. One leading contender for that energy source is the dissipation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves or turbulent fluctuations. Many wave-heating models for the corona and the solar wind presume that these fluctuations originate at or below the Sun's photosphere. However, this paper investigates the idea that magnetic reconnection may generate an additional source of MHD waves over a gradual range of heights in the low corona. A time-dependent Monte Carlo simulation of the mixed-polarity magnetic field is used to predict the properties of reconnection-driven coronal MHD waves. The total power in these waves is typically small in comparison to that of photosphere-driven waves, but their frequencies are much lower. Reconnection-driven waves begin to dominate the total power spectrum at periods longer than about 30 minutes. Thus, they may need to be taken into account in order to understand the low-frequency power-law spectra observed by both coronal spectropolarimetry and in-situ particle/field instruments. These low-frequency Alfven waves should carry more magnetic energy than kinetic energy, and thus they may produce less nonthermal Doppler broadening (in comparison to photosphere-driven high-frequency waves) in emission lines observed above the solar limb.},

	abstract = {Among the eruptive activity phenomena observed on the Sun, the most technology threatening ones are flares with associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar energetic particles (SEPs). Flares with associated CMEs and SEPs are produced by magnetohydrodynamical processes in magnetically active regions (ARs) on the Sun. However, these ARs do not only produce flares with associated CMEs and SEPs, they also lead to flares and CMEs, which are not associated with any other event. In an attempt to distinguish flares with associated CMEs and SEPs from flares and CMEs, which are unassociated with any other event, we investigate the performances of two machine learning algorithms. To achieve this objective, we employ support vector machines (SVMs) and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) using data from the Space Weather Database of Notification, Knowledge, Information (DONKI) of NASA Space Weather Center, \{{\textbackslash}it the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite\} (\{{\textbackslash}it GOES\}), and the Space-Weather Heliospheric and Magnetic Imager Active Region Patches (SHARPs). We show that True Skill Statistics (TSS) and Heidke Skill Scores (HSS) calculated for SVMs are slightly better than those from the MLPs. We also show that the forecasting time frame of 96 hours provides the best results in predicting if a flare will be associated with CMEs and SEPs (TSS=0.92\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.09 and HSS=0.92\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.08). Additionally, we obtain the maximum TSS and HSS values of 0.91\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.06 for predicting that a flare will not be associated with CMEs and SEPs for the 36 hour forecast window, while the 108 hour forecast window give the maximum TSS and HSS values for predicting CMEs will not be accompanying any events (TSS=HSS=0.98\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.02).},

	abstract = {Stellar activity signatures such as spots and plage can significantly limit the search for extrasolar planets. Current models of activity-induced radial velocity (RV) signals focused on the impact of temperature contrast in spots predicting the signal to diminish toward longer wavelengths. On the other hand, the relative importance of the Zeeman effect on RV measurements should grow with wavelength, because the Zeeman displacement itself grows with {\textbackslash}lambda, and because a magnetic and cool spot contributes more to the total flux at longer wavelengths. We model the impact of active regions on stellar RV measurements including both temperature contrast in spots and Zeeman line broadening. We calculate stellar line profiles using polarized radiative transfer models including atomic and molecular Zeeman splitting from 0.5 to 2.3{\textbackslash}mum. Our results show that the amplitude of the RV signal caused by the Zeeman effect alone can be comparable to that caused by temperature contrast. Furthermore, the RV signal caused by cool and magnetic spots increases with wavelength. We also calculate the RV signal due to variations in average magnetic field strength from one observation to the next, but find it unlikely that this can significantly influence the search for extrasolar planets. As an example, we derive the RV amplitude of the active M dwarf AD Leo as a function of wavelength using data from the HARPS spectrograph. The RV signal does not diminish at longer wavelengths but shows evidence for the opposite behavior. We conclude that the RV signal of active stars does not vanish at longer wavelength but sensitively depends on the combination of spot temperature and magnetic field; in active low-mass stars, it is even likely to grow with wavelength.},

	abstract = {Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events and their parent solar events (e.g. solar flares - SFs and coronal mass ejections - CMEs) are closely related. A wealth of statistical studies has indicated the dependence of the probability of occurrence of SEP events on the magnitude and the longitude of the SF, as well as the velocity and the width of the CME. However, most studies are limited to two dimensional correlations. In addition, similar coefficients are identified for the pair-wise correlation of the SEP peak intensity to both the SF magnitude and the CME speed. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the solar parameters are not independent. In this work, we perform a principal component analysis (PCA) on a set of six (6) solar variables (i.e. CME width and velocity, logarithm of the SF magnitude, SF longitude, duration and rise time), and we further apply logistic regression to infer the possible prediction of SEP events. In our analysis, we utilize 126 SEP events with complete solar information. Each SEP event is a vector in six dimensions (corresponding to the six solar variables used in this work). PCA transforms the input vectors into a set of orthogonal components. We applied logistic regression with a single categorical predictor, as well as, single or multiple explanatory variables. Furthermore, we validated our findings with the implementation of categorical scores (Probability of Detection - POD, False Alarm Rate –FAR). We present and interpret the obtained scores and we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the different implementations

	abstract = {During 42 years of observations the General Magnetic Field of the Sun as a star demonstrates a stable picture of variability with the activity cycle: during maximum activity GMF reaches ∼2 G, and during minimum it reaches ∼0.2 G. The frequencies of prominent peaks in the power spectrum of GMF significantly vary from one cycle of activity to another one. All data folded in phase with the equatorial synodic period ∼26.d9 shows a specific phase curve similar to a dipole with amplitude ∼0.2 G and the absolute ratio of positive to negative magnetic flux ∼0.9. That is, during four decades of observations the excess of the positive magnetic flux is concentrated on the one side of the Sun, the excess of the negative flux is concentrated on the opposite side, and this magnetic field does not reverse its polarity with the 22-year Hale solar cycle. In the case, when poloidal dipole axis coincides with rotation axis one can see a more complex picture of variability: the power spectrum for GMF values obtained at four minima of activity between 20 and 24 sunspot cycles demonstrates a large difference in relative amplitude of frequencies from the power spectrum for total GMF array and indicates the presence of the quadrupole component. Rough empirical estimation of the upper limit of the mean velocity of the poloidal dipole sign reverse for the Hale cycles from 1749 to 1997 gives 〈V 〉 ≈ 6.85 ± 0.05 m s–1. We suppose the presence of additional weak large-scale magnetic field on the Sun. The axis of the field lies near the equatorial plane. This weak large-scale magnetic field reflects properties of the stationary global magnetic field of the solar radiative interior on the surface of the Sun, which appears to be a third large-scale component of the magnetic field along with known toroidal and poloidal fields (© 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

The cataloged data are compared with direct daily measurements of the absolute line-of-sight field made at the Kitt Peak Observatory in 2003–2006 (original data with a resolution of 1″ averaged over the solar disk). The true absolute mean field strength averaged over the visible solar hemisphere is determined for 1968–2006 to be B 0 = 7.7 ± 0.2 G. This figure exceeds previous estimates by almost a factor of four. B 0 exhibits no appreciable slow trend over the entire 39-year interval, but varies substantially with the cycle. The period of this variation is 10.5 ± 0.7 yr, and its harmonic amplitude is 1.7 G. The magnetic flux of spots and active regions makes B 0 almost twice the field strength in the “normal” photosphere at the solar minimum, i.e., for the “quiet” Sun.},

	abstract = {The quiet nature of sunspot cycle 24 was disrupted during the second half of 2014 when the Sun’s large-scale field underwent a sudden rejuvenation: the solar mean field reached its highest value since 1991, the interplanetary field strength doubled, and galactic cosmic rays showed their strongest 27-day modulation since neutron-monitor observations began in 1957; in the outer corona, the large increase of field strength was reflected by unprecedentedly large numbers of coronal loops collapsing inward along the heliospheric current sheet. Here, we show that this rejuvenation was not caused by a significant increase in the level of solar activity as measured by the smoothed sunspot number and CME rate, but instead was caused by the systematic emergence of flux in active regions whose longitudinal distribution greatly increased the Sun’s dipole moment. A similar post-maximum increase in the dipole moment occurred during each of the previous three sunspot cycles, and marked the start of the declining phase of each cycle. We note that the north–south component of this peak dipole moment provides an early indicator of the amplitude of the next cycle, and conclude that the amplitude of cycle 25 may be comparable to that of cycle 24, and well above the amplitudes obtained during the Maunder Minimum.},

	abstract = {The worldwide network of neutron monitors (NMs) includes two stations, South Pole (SOPO/B)
and Dome C (DOMC/B), which are exceptionally sensitive to solar energetic particles. Their
locations on the high Antarctic plateau make them favorable for detection of low-energy particles
because of the low geomagnetic rigidity cutoff and the thin atmosphere above. This pair of cosmic
ray stations is able to register relatively weak solar energetic particle events, which would not have
been detected by the NM network otherwise. Since DOMC/B station is in operation only since
2015, now the NM network is more sensitive to a SEP event than ever before. Considering such
weak events as the "official" ground-level enhancements (GLEs) may break the homogeneity of
the GLE definition and cause an observational bias in studies based on the GLE occurrence rate
over decades.
In order to keep the "official" GLE list homogeneous, we propose to slightly modify the conventional
definition of a GLE, which refers to a statistically significant enhancement of the count rate
of at least two differently located neutron monitors over the background. The proposed change
is as follows: "... at least two neutron monitors, one of which is located near the sea level". We
also propose an introduction of a new class of SEP events called sub-GLE to identify the events
registered by high-elevation polar NMs but not satisfying the revised definition of a GLE.},

	abstract = {Abstract Neutron monitors (NMs) are ground?based detectors that measure variations of the Galactic cosmic ray flux at GV range rigidities. Differences in configuration, electronics, surroundings, and location induce systematic effects on the calculation of the yield functions of NMs worldwide. Different estimates of NM yield functions can differ by a factor of 2 or more. In this work, we present new Monte Carlo simulations to calculate NM yield functions and perform an absolute (not relative) comparison with the count rate of the Princess Sirindhorn Neutron Monitor (PSNM) at Doi Inthanon, Thailand, both for the entire monitor and for individual counter tubes. We model the atmosphere using profiles from the Global Data Assimilation System database and the Naval Research Laboratory Mass Spectrometer, Incoherent Scatter Radar Extended model. Using FLUKA software and the detailed geometry of PSNM, we calculated the PSNM yield functions for protons and alpha particles. An agreement better than 9\% was achieved between the PSNM observations and the simulated count rate during the solar minimum of December 2009. The systematic effect from the electronic dead time was studied as a function of primary cosmic ray rigidity at the top of the atmosphere up to 1 TV. We show that the effect is not negligible and can reach 35\% at high rigidity for a dead time {\textgreater}1 ms. We analyzed the response function of each counter tube at PSNM using its actual dead time, and we provide normalization coefficients between count rates for various tube configurations in the standard NM64 design that are valid to within ?1\% for such stations worldwide.},

In order to study cosmic rays using the world network of neutron monitor and needs to be able to model the neutron monitor count rate. Earlier it was difficult because of the poorly known yield function, which has been essentially revisited recently. We have presented a verification of the new yield function of the standard neutron monitor (NM) using a recently released data on the direct in situ measurements of the galactic cosmic rays energy spectrum during 2006?2009 (the period of the record high cosmic ray flux) by Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light?nuclei Astrophysics spaceborne spectrometer, and on NM latitude surveys performed during the period of 1994?2007, including periods of high solar activity. We found a very good agreement between the measured count rates of sea level NMs and the modeled ones in very different conditions: from low to high solar activity and from polar to tropical regions. This implies that the count rate of a sea level neutron monitor can be properly modeled in all conditions, using the new yield function.},

	abstract = {To determine the characteristics of galactic and solar cosmic ray flux near Earth by using neutron monitor measurements, the observation data are usually submitted to analysis procedures involving extensive calculations and expert knowledge. For space weather applications an equally valid method is desirable that is straightforward, fast, and simple, to allow quasi-automatic data analysis in near real-time. For this procedure, a parameterized neutron monitor yield function is needed. The Geant4 software package allows to simulate the interactions of cosmic ray particles with the atmosphere and the matter of the neutron monitor by the Monte Carlo method and therefore offers the possibility to determine the specific neutron monitor yield in function of rigidity, altitude, and type of neutron monitor. The paper presents the results of such simulations and a comparison with previously determined yield functions. The new yield function is parameterized and can therefore easily be adapted for any neutron monitor at any
geographic location and altitude. The application of the newly generated yield function is demonstrated with the analysis of the neutron monitor data of the worldwide network during the maximum phase of the ground level enhancement during the solar flare on 13 December 2006.},

	abstract = {A ground?based neutron monitor (NM) is a standard tool to measure cosmic ray (CR) variability near Earth, and it is crucially important to know its yield function for primary CRs. Although there are several earlier theoretically calculated yield functions, none of them agrees with experimental data of latitude surveys of sea?level NMs, thus suggesting for an inconsistency. A newly computed yield function of the standard sea?level 6NM64 NM is presented here separately for primary CR protons and α?particles, the latter representing also heavier species of CRs. The computations have been done using the GEANT?4 PLANETOCOSMICS Monte?Carlo tool and a realistic curved atmospheric model. For the first time, an effect of the geometrical correction of the NM effective area, related to the finite lateral expansion of the CR induced atmospheric cascade, is considered, which was neglected in the previous studies. This correction slightly enhances the relative impact of higher?energy CRs (energy above 5?10 GeV/nucleon) in NM count rate. The new computation finally resolves the long?standing problem of disagreement between the theoretically calculated spatial variability of CRs over the globe and experimental latitude surveys. The newly calculated yield function, corrected for this geometrical factor, appears fully consistent with the experimental latitude surveys of NMs performed during three consecutive solar minima in 1976?1977, 1986?1987, and 1996?1997. Thus, we provide a new yield function of the standard sea?level NM 6NM64 that is validated against experimental data.},

This minimum is being followed by a cycle with one of the smallest amplitudes in recent history. We perform an in-depth analysis of this minimum with helioseismology. We use Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) data to demonstrate that the frequencies of helioseismic oscillations are a sensitive probe of the Sun’s magnetic field: The frequencies of the helioseismic oscillations were found to be systematically lower in the minimum following Cycle 23 than in the minimum preceding it. This difference is statistically significant and may indicate that the Sun’s global magnetic field was weaker in the minimum following Cycle 23. The size of the shift in oscillation frequencies between the two minima is dependent on the frequency of the oscillation and takes the same functional form as the frequency dependence observed when the frequencies at cycle maximum are compared with the cycle-minimum frequencies. This implies that the same near-surface magnetic perturbation is responsible. Finally, we determine that the difference in the mean magnetic field between the minimum preceding Cycle 23 and that following it is approximately 1 G.},

	abstract = {In the current paradigm for the modulation of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), diffusion is taken to be the dominant process during solar maxima while drift dominates at minima. Observations during the recent solar minimum challenge the pre-eminence of drift at such times. In 2009, the ∼2 GV GCR intensity measured by the Newark neutron monitor increased by ∼5\% relative to its maximum value two cycles earlier even though the average tilt angle in 2009 was slightly larger than that in 1986 (∼20° vs. ∼14°), while solar wind B was significantly lower (∼3.9 nT vs. ∼5.4 nT). A decomposition of the solar wind into high-speed streams, slow solar wind, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs; including post-shock flows) reveals that the Sun transmits its message of changing magnetic field (diffusion coefficient) to the heliosphere primarily through CMEs at solar maximum and high-speed streams at solar minimum. Long-term reconstructions of solar wind B are in general agreement for the ∼1900-present interval and can be used to reliably estimate GCR intensity over this period. For earlier epochs, however, a recent 10Be-based reconstruction covering the past ∼104 years shows nine abrupt and relatively short-lived drops of B to ≲0 nT, with the first of these corresponding to the Sp\"orer minimum. Such dips are at variance with the recent suggestion that B has a minimum or floor value of ∼2.8 nT. A floor in solar wind B implies a ceiling in the GCR intensity (a permanent modulation of the local interstellar spectrum) at a given energy/rigidity. The 30–40\% increase in the intensity of 2.5 GV electrons observed by Ulysses during the recent solar minimum raises an interesting paradox that will need to be resolved.},

We are able to closely reproduce the main features of the SOHO /CDS GCR record using the modulation potential calculated from neutron monitor data by Usoskin et al. The GCR numbers show a clear solar cycle modulation: they decrease by 50\% from the 1997 minimum to the 2000 maximum of the solar cycle, then return to the 1997 level in 2007 and continue to rise, in 2009 December reaching a level 25\% higher than in 1997. This 25\% increase is in contrast with the behavior of Ulysses /KET GCR protons extrapolated to 1 AU in the ecliptic plane, showing the same level in 2008-2009 as in 1997. The GCR numbers are inversely correlated with the tilt angle of the heliospheric current sheet. In particular, the continued increase of SOHO /CDS GCRs from 2007 until 2009 is correlated with the decrease of the minimum tilt angle from 30° in mid-2008 to 5° in late 2009. The GCR level then drops sharply from 2010 January, again consistent with a rapid increase of the tilt angle to over 35°. This shows that the extended 2008 solar minimum was different from the 1997 minimum in terms of the structure of the heliospheric current sheet.},

The different methods of determining the neutron monitor response function of primary cosmic rays are reviewed and discussed including early and recent results. The authors also provide results from a new calculation (Clem, 1999) including angle dependent yield functions for different neutron monitor types which are calculated using a simulation of cosmic ray air showers combined with a detection efficiency simulation for different secondary particle species. Results are shown for IGY and NM64 configurations using the standard 10BF3 detectors and the new 3He detectors to be used in the Spaceship Earth Project (Bieber et al., 1995).

For the even cycles R24E = 77.9 with rise time Tr = 4.5 y’s.

The application of the data of solar flux F10.7 which cover only cycles (19–23) was taken in consideration and gives predicted maximum amplitude R24 10.7 = 126 with rise time Tr107 = 3.7 years, which are over estimation.

One-hour time series of the cosmic-ray muon intensity at the ground level are checked for correlation with European neutron monitors, with emphasis on occasional extreme solar events, e.g. Forbush decreases.},

	abstract = {The negative atmospheric temperature effect observed in the muon intensity measured by surface-level detectors is related to the atmospheric expansion during summer periods. According the first explanation given, the path of muons from the higher atmospheric level (where they are generated) to the ground becomes longer, and more muons decay, leading to a muon intensity decrease. A significant negative correlation, therefore, is expected between the altitude of the equi-pressure surface and the muon intensity. We compared measurements of the altitude of 100 hPa equi-pressure surface and data from the multidirectional muon detector installed at the Brazilian Southern Space Observatory in São Martinho da Serra, RS. Significant correlation coefficient were found (up to 0.95) when using data observed in 2008. For comparison, data from the multidirectional muon detector of Nagoya, located in the opposite hemisphere, is studied and an anti-phase in the cosmic ray variation related with the temperature effect is expected between data from detectors of Nagoya and São Martinho da Serra. The temperature influence is higher for the directional channels of Nagoya than for ones of São Martinho da Serra.},

	abstract = {The ability to predict times of greater galactic cosmic ray (GCR) fluxes is important for reducing the hazards caused by these particles to satellite communications, aviation, or astronauts. The 11-year solar-cycle variation in cosmic rays is highly correlated with the strength of the heliospheric magnetic field. Differences in GCR flux during alternate solar cycles yield a 22-year cycle, known as the Hale Cycle, which is thought to be due to different particle drift patterns when the northern solar pole has predominantly positive (denoted as qA{\textgreater}0 cycle) or negative (qA{\textless}0) polarities. This results in the onset of the peak cosmic-ray flux at Earth occurring earlier during qA{\textgreater}0 cycles than for qA{\textless}0 cycles, which in turn causes the peak to be more dome-shaped for qA{\textgreater}0 and more sharply peaked for qA{\textless}0. In this study, we demonstrate that properties of the large-scale heliospheric magnetic field are different during the declining phase of the qA{\textless}0 and qA{\textgreater}0 solar cycles, when the difference in GCR flux is most apparent. This suggests that particle drifts may not be the sole mechanism responsible for the Hale Cycle in GCR flux at Earth. However, we also demonstrate that these polarity-dependent heliospheric differences are evident during the space-age but are much less clear in earlier data: using geomagnetic reconstructions, we show that for the period of 1905 – 1965, alternate polarities do not give as significant a difference during the declining phase of the solar cycle. Thus we suggest that the 22-year cycle in cosmic-ray flux is at least partly the result of direct modulation by the heliospheric magnetic field and that this effect may be primarily limited to the grand solar maximum of the space-age.},

	doi = {10.5194/angeo-35-825-2017},
	abstract = {The diurnal variation (DV) in galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux is a widely observed phenomenon in neutron monitor data. The background variation considered primarily in this study is due to the balance between the convection of energetic particles away from the Sun and the inward diffusion of energetic particles along magnetic field lines. However, there are also times of enhanced DV following geomagnetic disturbances caused by coronal mass ejections or corotating interaction regions. In this study we investigate changes in the DV over four solar cycles using ground-based neutron monitors at different magnetic latitudes and longitudes at Earth. We divide all of the hourly neutron monitor data into magnetic polarity cycles to investigate cycle-to-cycle variations in the phase and amplitude of the DV. The results show, in general, a similarity between each of the A {\textless} 0 cycles and A {\textgreater} 0 cycles, but with a phase change between the two. To investigate this further, we split the neutron monitor data by solar magnetic polarity between times when the dominant polarity was either directed outward (positive) or inward (negative) at the northern solar pole. We find that the maxima and minima of the DV changes by, typically, 1–2 h between the two polarity states for all non-polar neutron monitors. This difference between cycles becomes even larger in amplitude and phase with the removal of periods with enhanced DV caused by solar wind transients. The time difference between polarity cycles is found to vary in a 22-year cycle for both the maximum and minimum times of the DV. The times of the maximum and minimum in the DV do not always vary in the same manner between A {\textgreater} 0 and A {\textless} 0 polarity cycles, suggesting a slight change in the anisotropy vector of GCRs arriving at Earth between polarity cycles. Polar neutron monitors show differences in phase between polarity cycles which have asymptotic directions at mid-to-high latitudes. All neutron monitors show changes in the amplitude of the DV with solar polarity, with the amplitude of the DV being a factor of 2 greater in A {\textless} 0 cycles than A {\textgreater} 0 cycles. In most cases the change in timing of the maximum /minimum is greatest with the stations' geomagnetic cut-off rigidity shows little variation in the DV phase with latitude. We conclude that the change in the DV with the dominant solar polar polarity is not as simple as a phase change, but rather an asymmetric variation which is sensitive to the neutron monitor's asymptotic viewing direction.},

	abstract = {Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are modulated by the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) both over decadal time scales (due to long-term, global HMF variations), and over time scales of a few hours (associated with solar wind structures such as coronal mass ejections or the heliospheric current sheet, HCS). Due to the close association between the HCS, the streamer belt, and the band of slow solar wind, HCS crossings are often associated with corotating interaction regions where fast solar wind catches up and compresses slow solar wind ahead of it. However, not all HCS crossings are associated with strong compressions. In this study we categorize HCS crossings in two ways: Firstly, using the change in magnetic polarity, as either away-to-toward (AT) or toward-to-away (TA) magnetic field directions relative to the Sun and, secondly, using the strength of the associated solar wind compression, determined from the observed plasma density enhancement. For each category, we use superposed epoch analyses to show differences in both solar wind parameters and GCR flux inferred from neutron monitors. For strong-compression HCS crossings, we observe a peak in neutron counts preceding the HCS crossing, followed by a large drop after the crossing, attributable to the so-called ‘snow-plough’ effect. For weak-compression HCS crossings, where magnetic field polarity effects are more readily observable, we instead observe that the neutron counts have a tendency to peak in the away magnetic field sector. By splitting the data by the dominant polarity at each solar polar region, we find that the increase in GCR flux prior to the HCS crossing is primarily from strong compressions in cycles with negative north polar fields due to GCR drift effects. Finally, we report on unexpected differences in GCR behavior between TA weak compressions during opposing polarity cycles.},

	abstract = {The global survey method (GSM) technique unites simultaneous ground-level observations of cosmic rays in different locations and allows us to obtain the main characteristics of cosmic-ray variations outside of the atmosphere and magnetosphere of Earth. This technique has been developed and applied in numerous studies over many years by the Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radiowave Propagation (IZMIRAN). We here describe the IZMIRAN version of the GSM in detail. With this technique, the hourly data of the world-wide neutron-monitor network from July 1957 until December 2016 were processed, and further processing is enabled upon the receipt of new data. The result is a database of homogeneous and continuous hourly characteristics of the density variations (an isotropic part of the intensity) and the 3D vector of the cosmic-ray anisotropy. It includes all of the effects that could be identified in galactic cosmic-ray variations that were caused by large-scale disturbances of the interplanetary medium in more than 50 years. These results in turn became the basis for a database on Forbush effects and interplanetary disturbances. This database allows correlating various space-environment parameters (the characteristics of the Sun, the solar wind, et cetera) with cosmic-ray parameters and studying their interrelations. We also present features of the coupling coefficients for different neutron monitors that enable us to make a connection from ground-level measurements to primary cosmic-ray variations outside the atmosphere and the magnetosphere. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the current version of the GSM as well as further possible developments and improvements. The method developed allows us to minimize the problems of the neutron-monitor network, which are typical for experimental physics, and to considerably enhance its advantages.},

	abstract = {Long-term variations of galactic cosmic rays were compared with the behavior of various solar activity indices and heliospheric parameters during the current solar cycle. This study continues previous works where the cosmic-ray intensity for the solar cycles 20, 21, and 22 was well simulated from the linear combination of the sunspot number, the number of grouped solar flares, and the geomagnetic index A p. The application of this model to the current solar cycle characterized by many peculiarities and extreme solar events led us to study more empirical relations between solar-heliospheric variables, such as the interplanetary magnetic field, coronal mass ejections, and the tilt of the heliospheric current sheet, and cosmic-ray modulation. By analyzing monthly cosmic-ray data from the Neutron Monitor Stations of Oulu (cutoff rigidity 0.81 GV) and Moscow (2.42 GV) the contribution of these parameters in the ascending, maximum, and descending phases of the cycle was investigated and it is shown that a combination of these parameters reproduces the majority of the modulation potential variations during this cycle. The approach applied makes it possible to better describe the behavior of cosmic rays in the epochs of the solar maxima, which could not be done before. An extended study of the time profiles, the correlations, and the time lags of the cosmic-ray intensity against these parameters using the method of minimizing RMS over all the considered period 1996 – 2006 determines characteristic properties of this cycle as being an odd cycle. Moreover, the obtained hysteresis curves and a correlative analysis during the positive polarity (qA{\textgreater}0, where q is the particle charge) and during the negative polarity (qA{\textless}0) intervals of the cycle result in significantly different behavior between solar and heliospheric parameters. The time lag and the correlation coefficient of the cosmic-ray intensity are higher for the solar indices in comparison to the heliospheric ones. A similar behavior also appears in the case of the intervals with positive and negative polarity of the solar magnetic field.},

	abstract = {Several studies show that temporal variations in the Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) intensity display a distinct 11-year periodicity due to solar modulation of the galactic cosmic rays in the heliosphere. The 11-year periodicity of GCRs is inversely proportional to, but out of phase with, the 11-year solar cycle, implying that there is a time lag between actual solar cycle and the GCR intensity, which is known as the hysteresis effect. In this study, we use the hysteresis effect to model the relationship between neutron counting rates (NCRs), an indicator of the GCR intensity, and sunspot numbers (SSNs) over the period that covers the last four solar cycles (20, 21, 22, and 23). Both linear and ellipse models were applied to SSNs during odd and even cycles in order to calculate temporal variations of NCRs. We find that ellipse modeling provides higher correlation coefficients for odd cycles compared to linear models, e.g. 0.97, 0.97, 0.92, and 0.97 compared to 0.69, 0.72, 0.53, and 0.68 for data from McMurdo, Swarthmore, South Pole, and Thule neutron monitors, respectively, during solar cycle 21 with overall improvement of 31 \% for odd cycles. When combined to a continuous model, the better correlation observed for the odd cycles increases the overall correlation between observed and modeled NCRs. The new empirical model therefore provides a better representation of the relationship between NCRs and SSNs. A major goal of the ongoing research is to use the new non-linear empirical model to reconstruct SSNs on annual time scales prior to 1610, where we do not have observational records of SSNs, based on changes in NCRs reconstructed from 10Be in ice cores.},

that there was a backscatter pulse from the anti-sun direction that was

minutes after the onset of the event. There was a preferential release
of very energetic particles (greater than 3 GV) from the solar corona,

majority of these lower rigidity (but still relativistic) particles were
released a few minutes later. In addition a unique set of values is

reproduce the observed increase at any location on the earth.},

	abstract = {To determine the characteristics of galactic and solar cosmic ray flux near Earth by using neutron monitor measurements, the observation data are usually submitted to analysis procedures involving extensive calculations and expert knowledge. For space weather applications an equally valid method is desirable that is straightforward, fast, and simple, to allow quasi-automatic data analysis in near real-time. For this procedure, a parameterized neutron monitor yield function is needed. The Geant4 software package allows to simulate the interactions of cosmic ray particles with the atmosphere and the matter of the neutron monitor by the Monte Carlo method and therefore offers the possibility to determine the specific neutron monitor yield in function of rigidity, altitude, and type of neutron monitor. The paper presents the results of such simulations and a comparison with previously determined yield functions. The new yield function is parameterized and can therefore easily be adapted for any neutron monitor at any
geographic location and altitude. The application of the newly generated yield function is demonstrated with the analysis of the neutron monitor data of the worldwide network during the maximum phase of the ground level enhancement during the solar flare on 13 December 2006.},

	abstract = {The neutron monitor provides continuous ground-based recording of the hadronic component in atmospheric secondary radiation which is related to primary cosmic rays. Simpson (1948) discovered that the latitude variation of the secondary hadronic component was considerably larger than the muon component suggesting the response of a neutron monitor is more sensitive to lower energies in the primary spectrum. The different methods of determining the neutron monitor response function of primary cosmic rays are reviewed and discussed including early and recent results. The authors also provide results from a new calculation (Clem, 1999) including angle dependent yield functions for different neutron monitor types which are calculated using a simulation of cosmic ray air showers combined with a detection efficiency simulation for different secondary particle species. Results are shown for IGY and NM64 configurations using the standard 10BF3 detectors and the new 3He detectors to be used in the Spaceship Earth Project (Bieber et al., 1995). The method of calculation is described in detail and the results are compared with measurements and previous calculations. A summary of future goals is discussed.},

We calculate the weak-field asymmetry (shift) by fitting the distributions of weak-field values to a shifted Gaussian. Hemispheric shifts derived from the three data sets agree very well, and increase systematically when reducing the spatial resolution of the map. Shifts of the northern and southern hemisphere are typically opposite to each other. Shifts follow the evolution of the trailing flux and have a strong solar cycle variation with maxima in the early to mid-declining phase of the solar cycle. The sign of the hemispheric weak-field shift is always the same as the polarity of the polar field in the respective hemisphere and solar cycle. We also find that shifts in the south are systematically larger in absolute value than in the north.},

The flux emerging in large active regions is determined using the sunspot number as a proxy, while the flux emergence in small ephemeral regions is described by an extended cycle whose amplitude and length are related to the corresponding sunspot cycle. Both types of regions contribute to the open flux, which is the source of the heliospheric field. The overlap of the activity cycles of ephemeral regions leads to a secular variation of the total cycle-related magnetic flux (active region flux + ephemeral region flux + open flux). The model results indicate that the total surface flux has doubled in the first half of the last century. The evolution of the open flux is in good agreement with the reconstruction by [CITE].},

HiSPARC is a collaboration of universities, scientific institutes and high schools. The majority of detection stations is hosted by high schools. A HiSPARC station consists of two or four scintillators placed inside roof boxes on top of a building. The measured response of a detector to single incoming muons agrees well with GEANT4 simulations. The response of a station to EASs agrees with simulations as well. A four-scintillator station was integrated in the KASCADE experiment and was used to determine the accuracy of the shower direction reconstruction. Using simulations, the trigger efficiency of a station to detect a shower as function of both distance to the shower core and zenith angle was determined. The HiSPARC experiment is taking data since 2003. The number of stations ({\textasciitilde}140 in 2019) still increases. The project demonstrates that its approach is viable for educational purposes and that scientific data can be obtained in a collaboration with high school students and teachers.},

Together with the high-precision data near the Earth taken by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and AMS-02, we derive the LIS spectra of helium, lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, and oxygen nuclei from a few MeV n−1 to TeV n−1, using a non-parameterization method. These LIS spectra are helpful in further studying the injection and propagation parameters of GCRs. The nearly 20 years of data recorded by ACE are used to determine the solar modulation parameters over solar cycles 23 and 24, based on the force-field approximation. We find general agreements of the modulation potential with the results inferred from neutron monitors and other cosmic-ray data.},

	abstract = {The evolution of active regions (AR) from their emergence through their long decay process is of fundamental importance in solar physics. Since large-scale flux is generated by the deep-seated dynamo, the observed characteristics of flux emergence and that of the subsequent decay provide vital clues as well as boundary conditions for dynamo models. Throughout their evolution, ARs are centres of magnetic activity, with the level and type of activity phenomena being dependent on the evolutionary stage of the AR. As new flux emerges into a pre-existing magnetic environment, its evolution leads to re-configuration of small-and large-scale magnetic connectivities. The decay process of ARs spreads the once-concentrated magnetic flux over an ever-increasing area. Though most of the flux disappears through small-scale cancellation processes, it is the remnant of large-scale AR fields that is able to reverse the polarity of the poles and build up new polar fields. In this Living Review the emphasis is put on what we have learned from observations, which is put in the context of modelling and simulation efforts when interpreting them. For another, modelling-focused Living Review on the sub-surface evolution and emergence of magnetic flux see Fan (2009). In this first version we focus on the evolution of dominantly bipolar ARs.},

precision and hence provide good constraints on seismic models. Here we
detect and characterize these valuable measures of the solar interior
from a 22 yr Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network data set. We report
mode frequencies, line widths, heights, amplitudes, and rotational
splitting, all with robust uncertainties. The new values of frequency,
rotational splitting, amplitude, and line width we provide will help
place new constraints on hydrostatic and rotational structure, plus
diagnostics of near-surface convection. Further to this, by assuming
simple power laws, we extrapolate mode properties to lower frequencies.
We demonstrate that the low-l low-frequency p modes have a low
signal-to-noise ratio and that this cannot be overcome simply by
continued observation. It will be necessary to observe the Sun in novel
ways to `beat' the intrinsic granulation noise.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. Solar Rossby waves ({\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater} modes) have recently been discovered in the near-surface horizontal flow field using the techniques of granulation-tracking and ring-diagram analysis applied to six years of SDO/HMI data.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. Here we apply time-distance helioseismology to the combined SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI data sets, which cover 21 years of observations from May 1996 to April 2017. The goal of this study is to provide an independent confirmation over two solar cycles and in deeper layers of the Sun.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. We have measured south-north helioseismic travel times along the equator, which are sensitive to subsurface north-south flows. To reduce noise, the travel times were averaged over travel distances from 6° to 30°; the mean distance corresponds to a p-mode lower turning point of 0.91 {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. The 21-year time series of travel-time measurements was split into three seven-year subsets and transformed to obtain power spectra in a corotating frame.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. The power spectra all show peaks near the frequencies of the classical sectoral Rossby waves for azimuthal wavenumbers in the range 3 ≤ {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ≤ 15. The mode frequencies and linewidths of the modes with {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ≤ 9 are consistent with a previous study whereas modes with {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ≥ 10 are shifted toward less negative frequencies by 10–20 nHz. While most of these modes have e-folding lifetimes on the order of a few months, the longest lived mode, {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 3, has an e-folding lifetime of more than one year. For each mode, the rms velocity at the equator is in the range of 1–3 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, with the largest values for {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ∼ 10. No evidence for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 2 sectoral mode is found in the power spectrum, implying that the rms velocity of this mode is below ∼0.5 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. This work confirms the existence of equatorial global Rossby waves in the solar interior over the past two solar cycles and shows that time-distance helioseismology is a promising technique to study them deep in the convection zone.},

The recent discovery of global-scale equatorial Rossby waves in the Sun, also called {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater} modes, prompted us to investigate their possible signature in stellar RV measurements. These {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater} modes are toroidal modes of oscillation whose restoring force is the Coriolis force; they propagate in the retrograde direction in a frame that co-rotates with the star. The solar {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater} modes with azimuthal orders 3 ≤ {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ≲ 15 were identified unambiguously because of their dispersion relation and their long e-folding lifetimes of hundreds of days.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} In this paper, we simulate the RV oscillations produced by sectoral {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater} modes with 2 ≤ {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ≤ 5 by assuming a stellar rotation period of 25.54 days and a maximum amplitude of the surface velocity of each mode of 2 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. This amplitude is representative of the solar measurements except for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 2 mode, which has not yet been observed on the Sun.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Sectoral {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater} modes with azimuthal orders {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 2 and 3 would produce RV oscillations with amplitudes of 76.4 and 19.6 cm s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} and periods of 19.16 and 10.22 days, respectively, for a star with an inclination of the rotation axis to the line of sight {\textless}i{\textgreater}i{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 60°. Therefore, they may produce rather sharp peaks in the Fourier spectrum of the radial velocity time series that could lead to spurious planetary detections.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Sectoral {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater} modes may represent a source of confusion in the case of slowly rotating inactive stars that are preferential targets for RV planet search. The main limitation of the present investigation is the lack of observational constraints on the amplitude of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 2 mode on the Sun.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore the evolution of sunspot latitude distribution and explore its relations with the cycle strength. With the progress of the solar cycle, the distributions in two hemispheres from mid-latitudes propagate toward the equator and then (before the usual solar minimum) these two distributions touch each other. By visualizing the evolution of the distributions in two hemispheres, we separate the solar cycles by excluding this hemispheric overlap. From these isolated solar cycles in two hemispheres, we generate latitude distributions for each cycle, starting from cycle 8 to cycle 23. We find that the parameters of these distributions, namely the central latitude (C), width (δ), and height (H), evolve with the cycle number, and they show some hemispheric asymmetries. Although the asymmetries in these parameters persist for a few successive cycles, they get corrected within a few cycles, and the new asymmetries appear again. In agreement with the previous study, we find that distribution parameters are correlated with the strengths of the cycles, although these correlations are significantly different in two hemispheres. The general trend features, i.e., (i) stronger cycles that begin sunspot eruptions at relatively higher latitudes, and (ii) stronger cycles that have wider bands of sunspot emergence latitudes, are confirmed when combining the data from two hemispheres. We explore these features using a flux transport dynamo model with stochastic fluctuations. We find that these features are correctly reproduced in this model. The solar cycle evolution of the distribution center is also in good agreement with observations. Possible explanations of the observed features based on this dynamo model are presented.},

To that end we present a novel model of the RSS and its observations that allows for the determination of a significant improvement in calibration for ground-based Sun-as-a-star Doppler velocity observations. We show that the previously neglected multiple scattering in the RSS vapour cell is significant and demonstrate its impact on the spatial weighting to the solar disk, combining the new instrumental weighting with a detailed treatment of terrestrial atmospheric effects and a model of the solar surface velocity field. The resulting simulation allows for the development of a new and successful correction for differential atmospheric extinction generating up to a 25\% increase in the signal-to-noise ratio at low frequencies (0.8 to 1.3 mHz). The improvement in signal to noise allows for the detection of low-frequency p modes with small associated errors in frequency and together with the fitting of mode structure, produces estimates of mode linewidth and power. Over the frequency range 972 to 1850 microHz we find the exponent of the frequency-linewidth dependence to be 7.5(0.4).},

A HiSPARC station consists of two or four scintillators placed inside roof boxes on top of a building. The measured response of a detector to single incoming muons agrees well with GEANT4 simulations. The response of a station to EASs agrees with simulations as well. A four-scintillator station was integrated in the KASCADE experiment and was used to determine the accuracy of the shower direction reconstruction. Using simulations, the trigger efficiency of a station to detect a shower as function of both distance to the shower core and zenith angle was determined. The HiSPARC experiment is taking data since 2003. The number of stations (∼140 in 2019) still increases.

For our analysis, we have used the data from different instruments onboard SOHO satellite. We have examined the flare size, source location, CMEs characteristics of associated SEPs.

	abstract = {Forbush decreases (FDs) are depletions in the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) count rate that last typically for about a week and can be caused by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) or corotating interacting regions (CIRs). Fast CMEs that drive shocks cause large FDs that often show a two-step decrease where the first step is attributed to the shock/sheath region, while the second step is attributed to the closed magnetic structure. Since the difference in size of shock and sheath region is significant, and since there are observed effects that can be related to shocks and not necessarily to the sheath region we expect that the physical mechanisms governing the interaction with GCRs in these two regions are different. We therefore aim to analyze interaction of GCRs with heliospheric shocks only. We approximate the shock by a structure where the magnetic field linearly changes with position within this structure. We assume protons of different energy, different pitch angle and different incoming direction. We also vary the shock parameters such as the magnetic field strength and orientation, as well as the shock thickness. The results demonstrate that protons with higher energies are less likely to be reflected. Also, thicker shocks and shocks with stronger field reflect protons more efficiently.},

	abstract = {The heliospheric current sheet (HCS) is the boundary between open oppositely directed magnetic field lines which commonly originate as the outward extension of the solar magnetic dipole. The dipole tilt, the rotation of the Sun, and the outward propagation of the solar wind cause peaks and valleys in the current sheet which spiral outward. The HCS extends throughout the heliosphere to the greatest distances reached by Pioneer and Voyager. It serves as a magnetic equator, and solar wind parameters including speed, temperature, density, and composition vary with distance from the HCS. Extrapolated back to the Sun, especially near solar minimum, the HCS corresponds to the low-latitude streamer belt. Both features are closely related to a neutral line obtained by extrapolating photospheric magnetic fields to a source surface at several solar radii. The current sheet and sector structure persist throughout the solar cycle including solar maximum. At 1 AU the width of the HCS is approximately 10,000 km while a surrounding plasma sheet is thicker by a factor of ∼30. The field inside the HCS does not simply decrease to a null and then reappear with the opposite sense. Instead, the field rotates at nearly constant magnitude from one polarity to the other. In spite of theoretical expectations that fields on opposite sides of the HCS will merge or reconnect, there is little evidence that such is occurring. Many scientific questions remain unanswered. What are the global properties of the HCS near solar maximum, and how faithfully are they reproduced by source surface models? Are multiple HCS crossings caused by waves on the current sheet or by multiple current sheets? What is the effect of coronal mass ejections on the HCS and vice versa?},

	abstract = {The study of Galactic Cosmic-ray electrons (CREs) saw important developments in recent years, with the assumption of positron production only in interaction of hadronic Cosmic-rays with interstellar matter challenged by new measurements of CRE spectrum and related quantities. Indeed, all recent experiments seem to confirm an hardening in the positrons, a feature that is totally in contrast with the all-secondaries hypothesis, even if significant disagreements are present about the CRE spectral behavior and the possible presence of spectral features. Together with insufficient precision of current measurements, these disagreements prevent the identification of the primary positron source, with models involving Dark matter or astrophysical sources like Super Nova Remnants and Pulsar Wind Nebula all able to explain current data. The fermi-LAT contribution to the CRE study was fundamental, with the 2009 measurement of the positron + electron spectrum extended to the 7 MeV - 1TeV range with a statistics already exceeding previous results by many order of magnitude; since then, the last statistic has largely increased, while the LAT event reconstruction was significantly improved. In this article the reader will find an extensive and historical review of the CRE science, a summary of the history of gamma astronomy before fermi, an accurate description of the LAT and of its data analysis, a review of the present knowledge about CRE spectrum and on the theories that try to explain it, and finally a description of the changes and improvements introduced in the LAT event reconstruction process at the beginning of 2015.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size ε and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more effciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter ε on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" samplers.},

However, in the last 30 years the field has been revolutionized by the ability to perform seismic investigations of stellar interiors. This revolution begun with the Sun, where helioseismology has been yielding information competing with what can be inferred about the Earth’s interior from geoseismology. The last two decades have witnessed the advent of asteroseismology of solar-like stars, thanks to a dramatic development of new observing facilities providing the first reliable results on the interiors of distant stars. The coming years will see a huge development in this field. In this review we focus on solar-type stars, i.e., cool main-sequence stars where oscillations are stochastically excited by surface convection. After a short introduction and a historical overview of the discipline, we review the observational techniques generally used, and we describe the theory behind stellar oscillations in cool main-sequence stars. We continue with a complete description of the normal mode analyses through which it is possible to extract the physical information about the structure and dynamics of the stars. We then summarize the lessons that we have learned and discuss unsolved issues and questions that are still unanswered.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} The diurnal variation (DV) in galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux is a widely observed phenomenon in neutron monitor data. The background variation considered primarily in this study is due to the balance between the convection of energetic particles away from the Sun and the inward diffusion of energetic particles along magnetic field lines. However, there are also times of enhanced DV following geomagnetic disturbances caused by coronal mass ejections or corotating interaction regions. In this study we investigate changes in the DV over four solar cycles using ground-based neutron monitors at different magnetic latitudes and longitudes at Earth. We divide all of the hourly neutron monitor data into magnetic polarity cycles to investigate cycle-to-cycle variations in the phase and amplitude of the DV. The results show, in general, a similarity between each of the \textit{A} \&lt; 0 cycles and \textit{A} \&gt; 0 cycles, but with a phase change between the two. To investigate this further, we split the neutron monitor data by solar magnetic polarity between times when the dominant polarity was either directed outward (positive) or inward (negative) at the northern solar pole. We find that the maxima and minima of the DV changes by, typically, 1–2 h between the two polarity states for all non-polar neutron monitors. This difference between cycles becomes even larger in amplitude and phase with the removal of periods with enhanced DV caused by solar wind transients. The time difference between polarity cycles is found to vary in a 22-year cycle for both the maximum and minimum times of the DV. The times of the maximum and minimum in the DV do not always vary in the same manner between \textit{A} \&gt; 0 and \textit{A} \&lt; 0 polarity cycles, suggesting a slight change in the anisotropy vector of GCRs arriving at Earth between polarity cycles. Polar neutron monitors show differences in phase between polarity cycles which have asymptotic directions at mid-to-high latitudes. All neutron monitors show changes in the amplitude of the DV with solar polarity, with the amplitude of the DV being a factor of 2 greater in \textit{A} \&lt; 0 cycles than \textit{A} \&gt; 0 cycles. In most cases the change in timing of the maximum /minimum is greatest with the stations' geomagnetic cut-off rigidity shows little variation in the DV phase with latitude. We conclude that the change in the DV with the dominant solar polar polarity is not as simple as a phase change, but rather an asymmetric variation which is sensitive to the neutron monitor's asymptotic viewing direction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this paper, we address this deficiency by consolidating Mount Wilson Observatory polar faculae data from four data reduction campaigns, validating it through a comparison with facular data counted automatically from Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) intensitygrams, and calibrating it against polar field measurements taken by the Wilcox Solar Observatory and average polar field and total polar flux calculated using MDI line-of-sight magnetograms. Our results show that the consolidated polar facular measurements are in excellent agreement with both polar field and polar flux estimates, making them an ideal proxy to study the evolution of the polar magnetic field. Additionally, we combine this database with sunspot area measurements to study the role of the polar magnetic flux in the evolution of the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF). We find that there is a strong correlation between HMF and polar flux at solar minimum and that, taken together, polar flux and sunspot area are better at explaining the evolution of the HMF during the last century than sunspot area alone.},

	abstract = {Faculae on the polar caps of the Sun, in short polar faculae (PFe), are investigated. They take part in the magnetic solar cycle. Here, we study the fine structures of PFe, their magnetic fields and their dynamics on short time scales. The observations stem from several periods in 2001 and 2002. They consist of spectropolarimetric data (Stokes {\textless}i{\textgreater}I{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}V{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) taken in the 6301.5 and 6302.5 Å and 6149.3 Å lines with the Gregory-Coudé Telescope (GCT) and the Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT) at the Observatorio del Teide on Tenerife. At the VTT, the “G\"ottingen” two-dimensional Fabry-Perot spectrometer was used. It allows image reconstruction with speckle methods resulting in spatial resolution of approximately 025 for broadband images and 05 for magnetograms. The application of singular value decomposition yielded a polarimetric detection limit of . We find that PFe, of size of 1´´ or larger, possess substantial fine structure of both brightness and magnetic fields. The brightness and the location of polar facular points change noticeably within 50 s. The facular points have strong, kilo-Gauss magnetic fields, they are unipolar with the same polarity as the global, poloidal magnetic field. The ambient areas, however, exhibit weak flux features of both polarities, as in the quiet Sun near disk center. Strong upflows of 1 km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} are detected in the intensity profiles of PFe. The zero-crossings of the Stokes {\textless}i{\textgreater}V{\textless}i/{\textgreater} profiles yield an average velocity of the magnetized plasma of km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} (towards the observer).},

by such space telescopes as CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS for determining
stellar rotation periods. While rotation periods of active stars can be
reliably determined, the light curves of many older and less active
stars, such as stars that are similar to the Sun, are quite irregular.
This hampers the determination of their rotation periods. Aims:
We aim to examine the factors causing these irregularities in stellar
brightness variations and to develop a method for determining rotation
periods for low-activity stars with irregular light curves. 
Methods: We extended the Spectral And Total Irradiance Reconstruction
approach for modeling solar brightness variations to Sun-like stars. We
calculated the power spectra of stellar brightness variations for
various combinations of parameters that define the surface configuration
and evolution of stellar magnetic features. Results: The short
lifetime of spots in comparison to the stellar rotation period, as well
as the interplay between spot and facular contributions to brightness
variations of stars with near solar activity, cause irregularities in
their light curves. The power spectra of such stars often lack a peak
associated with the rotation period. Nevertheless, the rotation period
can still be determined by measuring the period where the concavity of
the power spectrum plotted in the log-log scale changes its sign, that
is, by identifying the position of the inflection point. 
Conclusions: The inflection point of the (log-log) power spectrum is
found to be a new diagnostic for stellar rotation periods which is shown
to work even in cases where the power spectrum shows no peak at the
rotation rate.},

This study analyses the time lag between the GCR intensity and SSN, and hysteresis plots of the GCR count rate against SSN for Solar Cycles 20 – 23, to validate a methodology against previous results in the literature, before applying the method to provide a timely update on the behaviour of Cycle 24. Plots of SSN versus GCR show a clear difference between the odd- and even-numbered cycles. Linear and elliptical models have been fit to the data, with the linear fit and elliptical model proving the more suitable model for even- and odd-numbered solar-activity cycles, respectively, in agreement with previous literature. Through the application of these methods for Solar Cycle 24, it has been shown that Cycle 24 experienced a lag of two to four months between the GCR intensity and SSN, and this follows the trend of the preceding activity cycles, albeit with a slightly longer lag than previous even-numbered cycles. It has been shown through the hysteresis analysis that the linear fit is a better representative model for Cycle 24, as the ellipse model does not show a significant improvement, which is also in agreement with previous even-numbered cycles.},

	abstract = {We observe the abrupt end of solar-activity cycles at the Sun’s Equator by combining almost 140 years of observations from ground and space. These “terminator” events appear to be very closely related to the onset of magnetic activity belonging to the next solar cycle at mid-latitudes and the polar-reversal process at high latitudes. Using multi-scale tracers of solar activity we examine the timing of these events in relation to the excitation of new activity and find that the time taken for the solar plasma to communicate this transition is of the order of one solar rotation – but it could be shorter. Utilizing uniquely comprehensive solar observations from the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) we see that this transitional event is strongly longitudinal in nature. Combined, these characteristics suggest that information is communicated through the solar interior rapidly. A range of possibilities exist to explain such behavior: for example gravity waves on the solar tachocline, or that the magnetic fields present in the Sun’s convection zone could be very large, with a poloidal field strengths reaching 50 kG – considerably larger than conventional explorations of solar and stellar dynamos estimate. Regardless of the mechanism responsible, the rapid timescales demonstrated by the Sun’s global magnetic-field reconfiguration present strong constraints on first-principles numerical simulations of the solar interior and, by extension, other stars.},

	abstract = {The Sun provides the energy required to sustain life on Earth and drive our planet's atmospheric circulation. However, establishing a solid physical connection between solar and tropospheric variability has posed a considerable challenge across the spectrum of Earth-system science. The canon of solar variability, the solar fiducial clock, lies almost exclusively with the 400 years of human telescopic observations that demonstrates the waxing and waning number of sunspots, over an 11(ish) year period. Recent research has demonstrated the critical importance of the underlying 22-year magnetic polarity cycle in establishing the shorter sunspot cycle. Integral to the manifestation of the latter is the spatio-temporal overlapping and migration of oppositely polarized magnetic bands. The points when these bands emerge at high solar latitudes and cancel at the equator are separated by almost 20 years. Here we demonstrate the impact of these "termination" points on the Sun's radiative output and particulate shielding of our atmosphere through the dramatically rapid reconfiguration of solar magnetism. These events reset the Sun's fiducial clock and present a new portal to explore the Sun-Earth connection. Using direct observation and proxies of solar activity going back six decades we can, with high statistical significance, demonstrate an apparent correlation between the solar cycle terminations and the largest swings of Earth's oceanic indices---a previously overlooked correspondence. Forecasting the Sun's global behavior places the next solar termination in early 2020; should a major oceanic swing follow, our challenge becomes: when does correlation become causation and how does the process work?},

of the activity bands belonging to the 22 yr magnetic activity cycle.
Using a systematic analysis of ubiquitous coronal brightpoints and the

	abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated the existence of a new type of solar event, the "terminator." Unlike the Sun's signature events, flares and coronal mass ejections, the terminator most likely originates in the solar interior, at or near the tachocline. The terminator signals the end of a magnetic activity cycle at the Sun's equator and the start of a sunspot cycle at mid-latitudes. Observations indicate that the time difference between these events is very short, less than a solar rotation, in the context of the sunspot cycle. As the (definitive) start and end point of solar activity cycles the precise timing of terminators should permit new investigations into the meteorology of our star's atmosphere. In this article we use a standard method in signal
processing, the Hilbert transform, to identify a mathematically robust signature of terminators in sunspot records and in radiative proxies. Using a linear extrapolation of the Hilbert phase of the sunspot number and F10.7 cm solar radio flux time series we can achieve higher fidelity historical terminator timing than previous estimates have permitted. Further, this method presents a unique opportunity to project, from analysis of sunspot data, when the next terminator will occur, May 2020 (+4 , -1.5 months), and trigger the growth of Sunspot Cycle 25.},

The connection between the 24-hour harmonic amplitude of the SMMF and the presence of sunspots is examined.

However, because of the diversity of the proxy archives, it is difficult to build a homogeneous reconstruction. All previous studies were based on individual, sometimes statistically averaged, proxy datasets. Here we aim to provide a new consistent multi-proxy reconstruction of the solar activity over the last 9000 yr, using all available long-span datasets of {\textless}sup{\textgreater}10{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}Be and {\textless}sup{\textgreater}14{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}C in terrestrial archives.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} A new method, based on a Bayesian approach, was applied for the first time to solar activity reconstruction. A Monte Carlo search (using the {\textless}i{\textgreater}χ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} statistic) for the most probable value of the modulation potential was performed to match data from different datasets for a given time. This provides a straightforward estimate of the related uncertainties. We used six {\textless}sup{\textgreater}10{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}Be series of different lengths (from 500–10 000 yr) from Greenland and Antarctica, and the global {\textless}sup{\textgreater}14{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}C production series. The {\textless}sup{\textgreater}10{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}Be series were resampled to match wiggles related to the grand minima in the {\textless}sup{\textgreater}14{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}C reference dataset. The stability of the long data series was tested.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The Greenland Ice-core Project (GRIP) and the Antarctic EDML (EPICA Dronning Maud Land) {\textless}sup{\textgreater}10{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}Be series diverge from each other during the second half of the Holocene, while the {\textless}sup{\textgreater}14{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}C series lies in between them. A likely reason for the discrepancy is the insufficiently precise beryllium transport and deposition model for Greenland, which leads to an undercorrection of the GRIP series for the geomagnetic shielding effect. A slow 6–7 millennia variability with lows at ca. 5500 BC and 1500 AD in the long-term evolution of solar activity is found. Two components of solar activity can be statistically distinguished: the main component, corresponding to the “normal” moderate level, and a component corresponding to grand minima. A possible existence of a component representing grand maxima is indicated, but it cannot be separated from the main component in a statistically significant manner.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} A new consistent reconstruction of solar activity over the last nine millennia is presented with the most probable values of decadal sunspot numbers and their realistic uncertainties. Independent components of solar activity corresponding to the main moderate activity and the grand-minimum state are identified; they may be related to different operation modes of the dynamo.},

This effect exists in both observations and simulations, and it is believed to be caused by the correlated background noise. We study the temperature near the solar surface by means of a 3D hydrodynamic simulation of convection with a detailed treatment of radiation. The temperature spectrum at optical depth τcont = 1 has opposite asymmetry to the velocity spectrum, whereas the temperature measured at a fixed geometrical depth, corresponding to {\textless}τcont{\textgreater} = 1, has the same
asymmetry as velocity. We believe that the asymmetry reversal in temperature at τcont = 1 (and therefore in intensity) occurs partly because of the radiative transfer effects. High
temperature sensitivity of the opacity suppresses temperature
fluctuations on opposite sides of the mode peaks differently, thus causing the asymmetry reversal.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The advent of space-borne missions has substantially increased the number and quality of the measured power spectrum of solar-like oscillators. It now allows for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}p{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-mode line profiles to be resolved and facilitates an estimation of their asymmetry. The fact that this asymmetry can be measured for a variety of stars other than the Sun calls for a revisiting of acoustic mode asymmetry modelling. This asymmetry has been shown to be related to a highly localised source of stochastic driving in layers just beneath the surface. However, existing models assume a very simplified, point-like source of excitation. Furthermore, mode asymmetry could also be impacted by a correlation between the acoustic noise and the oscillating mode. Prior studies have modelled this impact, but only in a parametrised fashion, which deprives them of their predictive power.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} In this paper, we aim to develop a predictive model for solar radial {\textless}i{\textgreater}p{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-mode line profiles in the velocity spectrum. Unlike the approach favoured by prior studies, this model is not described by free parameters and we do not use fitting procedures to match the observations. Instead, we use an analytical turbulence model coupled with constraints extracted from a 3D hydrodynamic simulation of the solar atmosphere. We then compare the resulting asymmetries with their observationally derived counterpart.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We model the velocity power spectral density by convolving a realistic stochastic source term with the Green’s function associated with the radial homogeneous wave equation. We compute the Green’s function by numerically integrating the wave equation and we use theoretical considerations to model the source term. We reconstruct the velocity power spectral density and extract the line profile of radial {\textless}i{\textgreater}p{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-modes as well as their asymmetry.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We find that stochastic excitation localised beneath the mode upper turning point generates negative asymmetry for {\textless}i{\textgreater}ν{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} {\textless}i{\textgreater}ν{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}max{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and positive asymmetry for {\textless}i{\textgreater}ν{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}ν{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}max{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. On the other hand, stochastic excitation localised above this limit generates negative asymmetry throughout the {\textless}i{\textgreater}p{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-mode spectrum. As a result of the spatial extent of the source of excitation, both cases play a role in the total observed asymmetries. By taking this spatial extent into account and using a realistic description of the spectrum of turbulent kinetic energy, both a qualitative and quantitative agreement can be found with solar observations performed by the GONG network. We also find that the impact of the correlation between acoustic noise and oscillation is negligible for mode asymmetry in the velocity spectrum.},

The asymmetry is interpreted in terms of a model in which the solar oscillation cavity is compared to a Fabry-Perot interferometer with the source slightly outside the cavity. A phase difference between an outward direct wave and a corresponding inward wave that passes through the cavity gives rise to the asymmetry. The asymmetry is different in velocity and intensity observations. Neglecting the asymmetry when modeling the power spectrum can lead to systematic errors in the measurement of mode frequencies of as much as 10 exp -4 of the mode frequency.

interpretation locate the source of the oscillations to be approximately 60 km beneath the photosphere, the shallowest position suggested to date.},

These results suggest that simple classical diffusion is not responsible for the observed changes in field distribution, but that other processes play a significant role in flux dispersion.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We propose that the steep negative slope seen during the late-decay phase is due to magnetic flux reprocessing by (super)granular convective cells.},

	abstract = {How do you predict the parameters of future solar cycles? What is the role of dynamo theory in the cyclic activity of the Sun and similar stars? And what are the implications of chaos theory for stellar cycles? This book answers these questions and offers a timely review of studies in the cyclic activity of the Sun and other stars. This authoritative reference shows the importance of reliable predictions of the parameters of future solar cycles, and carefully explains the methods currently used to determine these (with special reference to the maximum of cycle 22). Some of the latest research into solar cycles is clearly presented; this includes helioseismology, observations of the extended activity cycle and the polar fields reversal, and contributions from dynamo theory and chaos theory. For graduate students and researchers, this monograph provides a much-needed synthesis of our understanding of activity cycles in the Sun and other stars.},

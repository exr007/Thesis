\section{Aims}\label{sec:HS_aims}
The HiSPARC project was set up with the detection philosophy of observing extended air showers (EAS), which are typically associated with PCRs with energy of $\sim10^{14}$~eV and above, that produce large footprints observable with many HiSPARC stations simultaneously. For PCRs with energy below $\sim10^{14}$~eV the air shower is small, with almost no observable footprint, and for PCRs with energy below $\sim10^{11}$~eV, there are typically less than one or two muons that reach the ground, making their observation difficult. 

The HiSPARC detectors are capable of observing any muons that reach them, therefore the project was motivated by the existing network of muon detectors which may have the capability of observing the cosmic rays associated with space weather events.

The principle aim of the project was to determine whether the existing HiSPARC network is capable of observing space weather events. This was initially achieved by investigating the data during periods of space weather activity to search for the associated signatures. In addition, simulations of air showers initiated by CRs were conducted to understand the expected muon flux at ground level.

From the results of the PLANETOCOSMICS simulations it was possible to calculate the rigidity cut-off for each HiSPARC station using equation~(\ref{eq:cut_off}). The cut-off rigidity calculated for the six HiSPARC stations for a vertical incidence upon the atmosphere (i.e. $0^\circ$ zenith angle) are shown in Table~\ref{tab:HS_stns} which show that there is little variation in $R_C$ between the HiSPARC stations and that they observe protons with rigidities in excess of $\sim 3$ GV. 


\begin{table}

		\caption{Properties of some of the HiSPARC stations: geographic longitude ($\lambda$), geographic latitude ($\phi$), altitude ($h$), and the geomagnetic vertical cut-off rigidity ($R_C$) calculated from the PLANETOCOSMICS simulations.}

			\hline
			& $R_C$  & $\lambda$ & $\phi$  & $h$  & No. Detectors\\

			\hline
			Nikhef/501 & 3.19 & 4.95 E & 52.36 N & 56.18 & 4 \\

			Eindhoven/8001  & 3.44 & 5.49 E & 51.45 N & 70.12 & 2 \\
			Birmingham University/14001  & 3.06 & 1.93 W & 52.45 N & 204.14 & 4  \\

			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}

The small variation between HiSPARC stations is due to their close proximity in geographic latitude and longitude. The values of $R_C$ calculated for the HiSPARC stations suggest that they should be able to observe higher energy SCRs, but may not be as susceptible as the higher latitude NMs where the effects of GLEs are highly observable.

\section{HiSPARC Observations}\label{sec:HS_obs}


[discuss preliminary observation of space weather FDs and GLEs for the events and singles data...]

[end with discussion on unknown PCRs observable and the effect of atmospheric weather conditions that need to be accounted for]

The effects of space weather on CRs has been outlined in [REF intro]. It was highlighted during communication with the UK Met Office that observations of GLEs are of more interest and importance to space weather forecasts and nowcasts. FDs are of lower interest and importance, however they were still searched for within the HiSPARC data. The events that were looked for within the HiSPARC data are outlined in Table~\ref{tab:space_weather_events}.

\section{Air Shower Simulations}\label{sec:CORSIKA}

In order to understand the footprint of air showers produced by PCRs, simulations of air showers were performed for a range of primary proton and $\alpha$-particle energies.

To simulate the CR air shower development, we employ CORSIKA ({\bf CO}smic {\bf R}ay {\bf SI}mulations for {\bf KA}scade), a Monte Carlo programme providing detailed simulations of the evolution of air showers initiated by cosmic rays particles through the atmosphere \citep{heck_extensive_2017}. The particles in the CORSIKA simulations are tracked through the atmosphere until they undergo interactions with atmospheric nuclei, decay due to their instability, or reach the ground level defined as the end of the simulation.

Proton and $\alpha$-particle initiated air showers were generated with energies ranging from $10^{9}$ to $10^{20}$~eV, and $4\times10^{9}$ to $10^{20}$~eV, respectively. In total $\sim 230000$ proton-initiated showers were simulated and $\sim 180000$ $\alpha$-particle-initiated air showers were simulated. The list of simulated air shower PCRs is shown in Table~\ref{tab:CORSIKA_sims}. For high energy, inelastic hadronic interactions within CORSIKA the QGSJET-II [REF] model was selected. Interactions of hadrons with energies below 80 GeV are simulated using GHEISHA [REF], which allowed for the simulation of PCRs in the regime of SCRs. In addition to these hadronic interactions, electromagnetic interactions within the CORSIKA simulations were described by the EGS4 [REF] model. Furthermore CORSIKA has a minimum muon energy limit that can be simulated of 10 MeV.

\input{Chapters/HiSPARC/corsika_table.tex}

There are several other user-definable setting within CORSIKA which are explained in-depth in the CORSIKA user's guide \citep{heck_extensive_2017}. The settings chosen within these simulation are breifly discussed below. Simulation thinning was enable in CORSIKA to reduce computation time and reduce the output file size. The observation level at which point the simulation cease was set at 100 m above sea level (compared to the $\sim 50$ m typical of the stations, however this difference is negligible for the air shower development.) The pre-defined central European atmosphere in October was used for all simulations, and western-European magnetic field was used as calculated with the \textit{Geomag} programme [REF]: B$_{\mathrm{x}}=18.799$~$\mu$T and B$_{\mathrm{z}}=44.980$~$\mu$T.

\subsection{Air Shower Footprints}\label{sec:CORSIKA_footprint}

The average footprint of muons at ground level was acquired from the output CORSIKA simulations. This was achieved by simply taking the distributino of the muons at ground level at the end of the simulation as a function of their distance from the shower core for each individual simulation realisation. For a given PCR energy the average air shower footprint distribution is calculated by combining the individual simulation realisations.

%[Discuss how distance between the HiSPARC station 2d/4d detectors will impact the ability to view certain PCR energies, and sets an lower limit on the energies observable in the standard trigger mode]

\end{figure}

The interpretation of Figure~\ref{fig:shower_footprints} can provide an understanding of the minimum energy of PCRs observable by the different stations within the HiSPARC network. The typical separation between the detectors in a HiSPARC station is $\sim 10$~m, however the separation between detectors can be up to as much as 20~m or as low as a couple of metres. This analysis of the air shower footprint shows the variation in PCR energy sampled varies marginally over this range of distances and suggests that HiSPARC stations will typical observe PCR with an energy of $\sim 10^{14}-10^{15}$~eV to meet the required trigger conditions.

\subsection{Barometric Correction}\label{sec:HS_P_corr}

It is understood that observations made by ground-based CR detectors are susceptible to atmospheric conditions. Atmospheric pressure effects the CR travel path due to the expansion and contraction of the atmosphere with varying pressure; hence the CR counts are observed to be negatively correlated to atmospheric pressure [add example plot to show].

The method of correcting for the barometric effect is discussed widely in the neutron monitor literature and is shown to depend on the barometric coefficient. If the cosmic ray flux is constant, $N$, CR variations depend on the local atmospheric pressure as described by equation~(\ref{eq:presscorr1}), where $\Delta N$ is the change in count rate, $\beta$ is the barometric coefficient, and $\Delta P = P - P_0$ is the deviation in pressure from the average ($P_0$) in the given time-period \citep{paschalis_online_2013}:

\begin{equation}
\Delta N = - \beta \, N \, \Delta P
\label{eq:presscorr1}
\end{equation}

Through the integration of equation~(\ref{eq:presscorr1}), the solution shows the dependence of cosmic ray intensity on pressure as in equation~(\ref{eq:presscorr2}). 

\begin{equation}
N = N_{0} \, e^{-\beta \, \Delta P}
\label{eq:presscorr2}
\end{equation}

Therefore by taking the natural logarithm of equation~(\ref{eq:presscorr2}), one can obtain the barometric coefficient through fitting the straight line in equation~(\ref{eq:presscorr3}) to the observed data, where $N_0$ may be assumed as the average count rate over the given time-period. 

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{ln} \left( \frac{\Delta N}{N} \right) = - \beta \, \Delta P
\label{eq:presscorr3}
\end{equation}

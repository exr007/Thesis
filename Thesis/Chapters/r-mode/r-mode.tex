\section{Introduction}\label{sec:rmode_intro}


Sectoral Rossby waves ($r$ modes) have recently been discovered in the Sun through observations of near-surface flows by the Solar Dynamics Observatory Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI) \citep{loptien_global-scale_2018, liang_time-distance_2019}.

$r$ modes are the toroidal modes of oscillation of a rotating, fluid body \citep{lanza_sectoral_2019} for which the dominant restoring force is the Coriolis force. They are understood to form in the high atmosphere on Earth, heavily influencing global weather. Rossby wave are associated with an undulation of a flow resulting in a pattern of radial vorticity of alternating sign. In the Sun we observe that this propagates in the retrograde direction in the Carrington reference frame.

Recently, \citet{loptien_global-scale_2018} provided an unambiguous detection of sectoral solar $r$ modes by mapping the horizontal flows in the solar photosphere during a 6-year period, using granules observed by SDO/HMI as tracers of the flow. Following this study \citet{liang_time-distance_2019} confirmed the detection of solar $r$ modes with time-distance helioseismology to measure deeper, subsurface flows in the meridional direction along the solar equator using both Solar and Heliospheric Observatory Michelson Doppler Imager (SOHO/MDI) and SDO/HMI data, covering 21 years. In addition, \citet{hanasoge_detection_2019} were also able to show the detection of solar $r$ modes using a normal-mode coupling technique on 2 years of SDO/HMI data.

Here we present the possible detection of the previously unobserved lowest frequency sectoral $r$ mode using 21 years of BiSON observations of the line of sight (LOS) solar mean magnetic field (SMMF) (for details, see \citet{chaplin_studies_2003}).

In an earlier study of the SMMF, the power spectrum of the BiSON observations was modelled using a combination of Lorentzian peaks and a convolution with the window function to account for the effect of gaps in the data. The full spectrum and the fit are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:BiSON_PSD}.

We can divide through by the model, to achieve the residual spectrum, in which we have investigated and potentially found the signature of $r$ modes.

\section{Aims}\label{sec:r-mode_aims}

In this chapter the residual power spectrum of the BiSON SMMF, after removing a model for the dominant signal, was investigated in order to search for the existence of r-modes. Within the residual spectrum we test for the existence of $r$ modes and where they appear to exist, a Lorentzian model is fit to understand the properties of the source.

Further analysis is provided using simulated data to better understand how an annual modulation of the $r$ mode observations would affect their frequencies. In addition, SDO/HMI data is investigated to support the argument that $r$ modes are not split in the power spectrum and instead we should observe the central frequency and lower amplitude side bands.

\section{Theory}\label{sec:r-mode_theory}

The detailed theory of the effect of $r$ modes on observational data was re-visited recently by \citet{lanza_sectoral_2019} in light of the solar observations, in an effort to determine the effect on radial velocity detections of exoplanets.

Under the assumption of a slow, uniformly rotating sphere (with angular velocity, $\Omega$, where $\Omega^2 << GMR^{-3}$), the frequencies of global $r$ modes in the Carrington rotating frame is well approximated by eq.~(\ref{eq:dispersion_rel}), where $l > 0$ is the angular degree and $m$ is the azimuthal order \citep{loptien_global-scale_2018, lanza_sectoral_2019}.

\begin{equation}
\nu_{carr} = - \frac{2m\Omega}{l(l + 1)}
\label{eq:dispersion_rel}
\end{equation}

In an inertial frame the observed r-mode frequencies will be \citep{lanza_sectoral_2019}:

\begin{equation}
\nu_{\mathrm{in}}(l,m) \approx m\Omega - \frac{2m\Omega}{l(l + 1)}  = m\Omega \left(1 - \frac{2}{l(l + 1)}\right)
\label{eq:r-mode}
\end{equation}

where $\Omega$ is the mean sidereal rotation rate, and $l$ and $m$ are the angular and azimuthal degree, respectively. Sectoral Rossby waves are obtained by setting $l=m$ in this equation. A consequence is that they propagate with a retrograde phase velocity as $\nu / m = -2 \Omega/[m(m + 1)] < 0$.

An Earth-based observer, orbiting the sun, shall expect to observe frequencies adjusted by the orbital frequency, $\nu_\oplus \, \approx \, 31.7$nHz, given by equation~(\ref{eq:r-mode_obs}).

\begin{equation}
\nu_{\mathrm{obs}}(l,m) = \nu_{\mathrm{in}}(l,m) - m\nu_{\oplus}
\label{eq:r-mode_obs}
\end{equation}

In addition, due to the tilt of the ecliptic with respect to the solar equatorial plane (the solar $B_0$ angle), the visibility of the modes will vary on a time--scale of 1--yr, meaning we expect to actually observe split peaks at frequencies of $\nu_{\mathrm{obs}}(l,m) \pm \nu_{\oplus}$ \citep{lanza_sectoral_2019}).

Based on this theory, we can compare the observed sectoral $r$ modes with those predicted. These frequencies are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:r-modes}.

\section{Methodology}\label{sec:r-mode_method}

\subsection{Testing the Residual Spectrum}
In order to investigate the presence of Rossby wave modes in the power spectrum of the BiSON SMMF, statistical significance tests were employed to test the probability of finding power in the residual spectrum.

We assume negative exponential statistics (i.e. $\chi^2$ 2-degrees of freedom distribution), and that the bins in the power spectrum are uncorrelated (an assumption which may be incorrect due to the low fill-factor of the BiSON SMMF data). Then we can find the false alarm probability, or probability to observe power in a given frequency bin, $\nu$, that is greater than or equal to a given threshold.

This can be generalised using the cumulative binomial distribution. The probability of finding at least $r$ spikes in $N$-bins at or above a relative power level, $s_{\nu}$, is given by equation~(\ref{eq:binom_CDF}), where $s_{\nu} = P(\nu)/\langle P(\nu) \rangle$, and $\langle P(\nu) \rangle$ is reduced to 1 when we compare the power relative to this estimate, i.e. the residual PSD.

\begin{equation}
p[r; p(s_\nu), N] = 1 - Pr(X < s_{\nu}) = \sum_{r=r}^{N} \binom{N}{r} \, p(s_{\nu})^r \, [1 \, - \, p(s_{\nu})]^{N-r}
\label{eq:binom_CDF}
\end{equation}

By applying equation~(\ref{eq:binom_CDF}) to the residuals of in the power spectrum, we can test whether there are any significant peaks in the residual power spectrum; a low value for $p[r; p(s_\nu), N]$ indicates that the power in that bin is unlikely to be a statistical fluctuation, and therefore is considered a statistically significant spike.

%We assume negative exponential statistics (i.e. $\chi^2$ 2-degrees of freedom distribution), and that the bins in the power spectrum are uncorrelated (an assumption which may be incorrect due to the low fill-factor of the BiSON SMMF data), then we can state the probability to observe power in a given frequency bin, $\nu$, that is greater than or equal to $P(\nu)$ is:
%
%\begin{equation}
%p[P(\nu)] = \frac{1}{P_{lim}(\nu)} \mathrm{exp}\left(-\frac{P(\nu)}{P_{lim}(\nu)}\right) \; \mathrm{or; } \; p[P(\nu)] = \frac{1}{\langle P(\nu) \rangle} \mathrm{exp}\left(-\frac{P(\nu)}{\langle P(\nu) \rangle}\right),
%\label{eq:p_power_prob}
%\end{equation}
%
%
%where $P_{lim}(\nu)$ is the limit spectrum or $\langle P(\nu) \rangle$ is a well-fitting model/estimate to the spectrum. Then considering the observed power relative to the estimate for the PSD, equation~(\ref{eq:p_power_prob}) may be written more concisely as:
%
%\begin{equation}
%p(s_{\nu}) = e^{(-s_{\nu})},
%\label{eq:p_power_prob_concise}
%\end{equation}
%
%where,
%
%\begin{equation}
%s_{\nu} = P(\nu)/\langle P(\nu) \rangle,
%\label{eq:s_v}
%\end{equation}
%
%and $\langle P(\nu) \rangle$ is reduced to 1 when we compare the power relative to this estimate, i.e. the residual PSD.
%
%In reality, we use the $\chi^2$ cumulative distribution function to compute the probability of power, which is given by equation~(\ref{eq:chi2_CDF}), where $k$ is the number of degrees of freedom, $\gamma(s,t)$ is the lower incomplete gamma function and $P(s,t)$ is the regularized gamma function. 
%
%\begin{equation}
%F(x; \, k) = \frac{\gamma (\frac{k}{2}, \, \frac{x}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{k}{2})} = P\left(\frac{k}{2}, \, \frac{x}{2}\right)
%\label{eq:chi2_CDF}
%\end{equation}
%
%
%Using these expressions, we can rewrite the equation for $P(s_{\nu})$ as given by equation~(\ref{eq:chi2_prob_concise}). This allows us to compute the probability of statistically significant peaks in the residuals for re binned data.
%
%\begin{equation}
%p(s_{\nu}) = 1 \, - \, F(2s_{\nu}; \, k) =1 \, - \, P\left(\frac{k}{2}, \, s_{\nu}\right)
%\label{eq:chi2_prob_concise}
%\end{equation}
%
%
%The probability that a bin has power at or above the level $s_{\nu}$ is therefore given by equation~(\ref{eq:p_power_prob_concise}), or more generally by equation~(\ref{eq:chi2_prob_concise}), hence the probability that we fail to find a bin with power at or above the level $s_{\nu}$ is $1 \, - \, p(s_{\nu})$; thus the probability of failing to find a bin with power at or above $s_{\nu}$ in $N$-bins in the spectrum is $[1 \, - \, p(s_{\nu})]^N$. Therefore the probability to find at least one bin with power at or above $s_{\nu}$ in N-bins in the spectrum is:
%
%\begin{equation}
%p_N = 1\, - \, [1 \, - \, p(s_{\nu})]^N
%\label{eq:p_N}
%\end{equation}
%
%where a low value for $p_N$ indicates that the spike in power in that bin is unlikely to be a statistical fluctuation, and therefore is considered a statistically significant spike.
%
%This can be generalised using the cumulative binomial distribution. The probability of finding at least $r$ spike in $N$-bins at or above the relative power level $s_{\nu}$ is given by equation~(\ref{eq:binom_CDF}), which is equal to equation(\ref{eq:p_N}) when $r=1$.
%
%\begin{equation}
%p[r; p(s_\nu), N] = 1 - Pr(X < s_{\nu}) = \sum_{r=r}^{N} \binom{N}{r} \, p(s_{\nu})^r \, [1 \, - \, p(s_{\nu})]^{N-r}
%\label{eq:binom_CDF}
%\end{equation}
%
%By applying equation~(\ref{eq:binom_CDF}) to the residuals of in the power spectrum, we can test whether there are any significant peaks in the residual power spectrum.

\subsection{Modelling {\it r} mode Profiles}
In the location of any suspected $r$ mode in the residual spectrum, we can model the profile of the peak by using a Lorentzian distribution, using the form expressed by eq.~(\ref{eq:lorentzian}), where $A$ is the amplitude of the signal, $\Gamma$ is the line width of the distribution, and $\nu_0$ is the central frequency of the distribution.

\begin{equation}
P(\nu) = \frac{2A^2/(\pi \Gamma)}{1 + (2(\nu - \nu_0)/\Gamma)^2}
\label{eq:lorentzian}
\end{equation}

Modelling was performed using the {\verb pymc3 } No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) extension to a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling algorithm \citep{salvatier_probabilistic_2016}.

\section{Results}\label{sec:r-mode_results}

\subsection{Testing the Residual Spectrum}

The residual spectrum in shown in Figure~\ref{fig:residuals}, with the removed model and locations of $r$ mode frequencies predicted by \citet{lanza_sectoral_2019} over-plotted.

It is clear from Figure~\ref{fig:residuals} that there appears to be a resolved peak in both the location of the $l=m=2$ $r$ mode and perhaps also the upper B$_0$-variation-modulated $l=m=3$ $r$ mode.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

Also over plotted as vertical solid lines are the expected locations of the 4 lowest-frequency sectoral $r$ modes and the dashed lines, the locations of the B$_0$ variation frequency splitting.}  \label{fig:residuals}
\end{figure}

The statistics tests were performed on the residual spectrum for various re-binning factors, n. The plots summarising the statistics tests are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:BiSON_new_asymm_stats} for re-binning factors of n = 1, 2, 5, and 10.

	\label{fig:BiSON_new_asymm_stats}
\end{figure}


These tests suggest that the feature around 0.5~$\mu$Hz may be a signal related to r-modes, as its location is roughly correct for the $l=m=2$ mode consistently has a low false alarm (FA) probability. The other low FA probability features tend to be associated with the residuals from the main harmonics of the SMMF signal, and suggests a slight failing of the main PSD model.

In particular in Figure~\ref{fig:BiSON_new_asymm_stats_n2}, there is compelling evidence to suggest that this peak is significant. Following on from this, in order to solidify this conjecture, we aim to fit a model to the residuals around this peak in order to confirm whether the properties of the peak resemble those suggested by \citet{loptien_global-scale_2018}, \citet{liang_time-distance_2019}, and \citet{lanza_sectoral_2019}.


\subsection{Modelling {\it r} mode Profiles}

Using the model for the Lorentzian peak (eq.~\ref{eq:lorentzian}), we model the residual spectrum around the location of the potential  $l=m=2$ mode. The results of the fit are given in Table \ref{tab:rmode_fit_params} and the fit to the residuals is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rmode_asymm_fit}.

\begin{table}
	\begin{center}
		\caption{Median posterior values of the Lorentzian model for the r-mode peak in the BiSON SMMF PSD residuals. Numbers in brackets denote uncertainties on the last 2 digits, and all uncertainties correspond to the 68\% credible intervals either side of the median.}
		\label{tab:rmode_fit_params}
		\begin{tabular}{l c r}
			\hline
			{Parameter} & {Value} & {Unit} \\
			\hline
			
			{$\nu_0$} & {0.5500$\left(_{-16}^{+16}\right)$} & {$\mu\mathrm{Hz} $}\\
			
			{$\Gamma$} & {0.0057$\left(_{-29}^{+47}\right)$} & {$\mu\mathrm{Hz} $} \\
			
			{$A$} & {0.253$_{-0.050}^{+0.066}$} & {--} \\
			
			
			{$bgnd$} & {0.99$\pm 0.16$} & {--} \\	
			
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}

The median of the posterior distribution for the width parameter suggests an e-folding lifetime ($1/(\pi \Gamma)$) of around 650 days ($\sim 1.8$ years), which follows the order magnitude of the lifetime suggested by low-$m$ Rossby modes. The lowest $r$ mode observed, $l=m=3$, was shown to exhibit a lifetime of over a year ($\sim 1.4$ years) by \citet{liang_time-distance_2019}. The $l=m=4$ were observed by both \citet{loptien_global-scale_2018} and \citet{liang_time-distance_2019} to have a lifetime of $\sim 0.6$ years and $\sim 0.3$ years, respectively. There seems to be a slight increasing trend in the mode lifetimes observed by \citet{loptien_global-scale_2018} and \citet{liang_time-distance_2019} of longer lifetimes for lower $m$, therefore the long lifetime found here for the $l=m=2$ mode is entirely reasonable and in-line with current observations.

In particular, we can see that the background is $\sim 1$, which is expected for such a fit to residual PSD data. Due to the accuracy of the background, the agreement between the central frequency of the fit to the $l=m=2$ mode, and the agreement in the order of magnitude of the e-folding lifetime, we believe there is strong evidence to suggest that this peak, which has shown to be significant through the false-alarm statistics tests, is indeed the $l=m=2$ sectoral $r$ mode, observed in the BiSON SMMF data.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:r-mode_discussion}


Despite the promising results presented in the previous section there remained an open question around the way the Rossby waves manifest themselves in the power spectrum. It was suggested by \citet{lanza_sectoral_2019} that the mode should be split into 2 frequencies due to the annual variation of the B$_0$ angle, but the observed peak in the BiSON spectrum is located at approximately the location of the central frequency; therefore not split due to this modulation. We needed to determine if this was physically observable.

Figure \ref{fig:l2m2} shows a schematic diagram of the flow of a $l=2=m$ sectoral $r$ mode. One can clearly see from the more visible purple region of the schematic, the southern hemisphere flow is oriented out of the page, whereas the northern hemisphere flow is oriented into the page. Due to the B$_0$ modulation, a varying of the sign of the flow would be observed over this region, i.e the velocity of the flow. In the more red-green regions the schematic, the flow is more transverse, hence this would contribute less to the effect of the B$_0$ modulation.

We needed to therefore understand whether the SMMF observations have a hemispheric dependence that would lead to a change sign in the observations due to the B$_0$ variation. In addition, this raised the question of how the mode was affected in the power spectrum by the B$_0$ modulation; either split into separate peaks as suggested by \citet{lanza_sectoral_2019} or instead was it possible that we could have a situation where the mode at the central frequency remained?

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{l2m2.png}
	\caption{Mode displacement schematic for an $l=m=2$ $r$ mode \citep{strohmayer_neutron_2014}}  \label{fig:l2m2}
\end{figure}

To investigate the splitting of the mode, a simple model was produced whereby a sinusoid function (with a period of $\sim$25 days) was modulated by either a cosine or rectified cosine function (with a period of 1 year). In the former, using the cosine modulation, this represents observing the sign of the flow varying with the B$_0$ modulation. Conversely in the latter simulation, this instead represents a variation of the amplitude, and it does not change the sign. Figure \ref{fig:modulation} shows the time series of the two cases to more clearly show their difference. The power spectrum of each case was then produced and are shown in Figure \ref{fig:modulation_PSDs} to demonstrate the differences in the modes produced.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.65\columnwidth]{modulation_plot.png}
	\caption{Time series of the velocity and amplitude modulation toy model simulations. The blue curve shows the velocity modulation, i.e. modulating using a cosine with period of 1 year, whereas the orange curve shows the amplitude modulation, i.e. modulating using a rectified cosine with period 1 year.}  \label{fig:modulation}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!ht]

	{\includegraphics[width=0.47\columnwidth]{v_mod.png}} 
	\qquad
	\subfloat[Amplitude modulation]{\includegraphics[width=0.47\columnwidth]{a_mod.png}}
	\caption{Power spectra for the two modulation methods, showing the difference in the way the modulation has changed the frequency of the observed mode.}  \label{fig:modulation_PSDs}
\end{figure}

One can clearly see the difference in the power spectrum produced in each of the cases. In the velocity modulation case, we see a splitting of the oscillation mode into two peaks split around the expected mode frequency by $\pm \nu_{\oplus}$. There exists no more power at the central mode frequency in this case. In the amplitude modulation case, we see a production of sidebands at $\pm 2\nu_{\oplus}$ however the expected mode frequency remains in this scenario and has a significantly higher peak height, a ratio of ~90:10 in favour of the central peak.

We have shown that it is possible to retain the central frequency of the $r$ mode in the power spectrum  if the B$_0$ modulates the amplitude of the observations and not the sign. It is now necessary to understand whether the two hemispheres of the Sun contribute signals that are more analogous with the velocity modulation, or the amplitude modulation. In the former, velocity modulation, we would expect to see the two hemispheres as opposite, inverse signals, displaying anti-correlation. In the latter, amplitude modulation, we would expect to see the signals from each hemisphere that track each other, and which can be both positive, negative, and overlap.

We can investigate how the two hemispheres of the Sun contribute to the SMMF through analysis of SDO/HMI data. To do this, we have acquired 720s-cadence magnetograms from SDO/HMI using the {\verb SunPy } python module \citep{barnes_sunpy_2020} over a 5-month period between the beginning of January 2011 to the end of May 2011, and separately averaged the Northern and Southern hemispheres' contributions to the total, disk-averaged SMMF. The plot of this data is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:HMI_MF}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\subfloat[2011]
	{\includegraphics[width=0.47\columnwidth]{HMI_MF_2011.png}} 
	\qquad
	\subfloat[2014]{\includegraphics[width=0.47\columnwidth]{HMI_MF_2014.png}}
	\caption{SDO/HMI SMMF split into hemispheres and compared to other SMMF sources during (a) 2011, and (b) 2014. The top panel in each figure shows the north (N), south (S), and total disk-averaged mean magnetic field, for both the full solar disk and from pixels within 99\% of solar radius. The bottom panels show a comparison between the SMMF, as observed BiSON, Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO), and HMI (full disk and the 99\% disk).}  \label{fig:HMI_MF}
\end{figure}


The hemispheric contributions to the total, disk-averaged SMMF can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:HMI_MF} to track each other and both become positive or negative. We believe this plot is critical in our understanding of how the $r$ modes would be manifested in the power spectrum due to the variation of the B$_0$ angle. As there's no clear anti correlation between the two hemispheres, this is a good indication that the SMMF signal would expect to be amplitude modulated and not change sign, which we have shown to result in a central frequency and sidebands in the power spectrum. It is therefore possible to conclude that we are confident we are observing the $l=2=m$ $r$ mode.

- [DONE] - page 55: need to take on-board the comment to introduce the raspbery pi earlier up when!
- [DONE] - page 56: depending on how above goes, add space between figures!
- [] - page 59: add in some equations on atmospheric corrections method?
- [DONE] - page 61: mention chance more!
- [DONE] - page 63: re-plot to show orange lines more clearly???
- [DONE] - page 65: re-plot to show orange lines more clearly???
- [DONE] - page 70: maybe remove this bit on the smoothing to remove diurnal variations...? what does it really add?!?!?
- [DONE] - page 70: re-cast sentence to make it more positive!
- [] - page 77: comments on the stats test, to discuss with Bill
		(on this point it's difficult as we didn't really get benefit from 0.1 threshold, so use dthe 0.9 level instead, BUT! what this is saying in there's a 90% chance to see a peak exceeding the threshold by chance in the 48-hr window. It's difficult because we're using this to find small increases in the signal. Two tnings to vary are the p-threshold and N. VArying threshold we can see limits the stuff that we can see, and stops us from seeing anything until around 5-7%. Varying N basically varie sthe SNR to observe something, and keeping reducing N to something on the order of a GLE width would hopefully decrease the number of expected - by chance - observations to something closer to the 0.1 level (noting on 0.1 * 1000 iteratins, expeect ~ 0.1 * 1000 = 100 overall exceeding level), so changing N to get something which is similar to this will be useful as it limits the amount of noise picked up but reduces SNR to allow us to see a low-magnitude GLE)
